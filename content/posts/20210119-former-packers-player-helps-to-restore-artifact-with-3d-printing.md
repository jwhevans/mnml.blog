Here’s a story from [3DPrint.com][1] that ticks all my boxes.

>From artwork and historic buildings to monuments and other priceless artifacts, technologies like 3D scanning and 3D printing are often called on to help restore and preserve touchstones of history. A recent example is a 193-year-old sterling silver menorah that belongs to the Mollie and Louis Kaplan Museum of Judaica at Congregation Beth Yeshurun, which houses more than 700 historical pieces dating as far back as the 17th century. Made in Russia in 1827, this menorah stands almost two feet tall, and features eight hinged oil lamps in the form of lions; unfortunately, one of the lions went missing sometime in the last thirty years.

Herman Fontenot is the Business Development Manager for 3DPrint Texas, the company that was hired to do the restoration. Fontenot played running back for the Cleveland Browns from 1985-1988 and the Green Bay Packers from 1989-1990. He played longer for the Browns but I’ll claim him.

This wasn’t a simple upload an STL and print type of job. The team had to use 3D scanning to develop a base model. They had to use 3D sculpting to add fine details. They employed 3D printing to produce high resolution molds, and they used the age old lost wax casting method to pour a new silver lion. It’s a beautiful restoration.
