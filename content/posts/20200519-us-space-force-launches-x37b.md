The new U.S. Space Force has launched its first mission. Sunday the Boeing X37-B Space Plane was sent to orbit aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. The Space Plane has spent a significant amout of time in orbit but its [missions are closely held secrets][1].

Two NASA experiments are [publicly disclosed on the flight manifest][2] and it is reported that there is also a classified military payload. One of the NASA experiments is designed to test power beaming from space to terrrestrial objects. The U.S. military is interested in this technology for long duration drone flights and forward operational bases. Commerical uses for this type of technology are also quite large.
