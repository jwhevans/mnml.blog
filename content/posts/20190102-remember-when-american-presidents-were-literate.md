In the June 1918 issue of [The Atlantic][1], our former President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt penned a review of a contemporary piece on the behavior of African ostriches. It was the last piece he published in *The Atlantic*. It isn’t a particularly great piece. He wrote many things that were better, but it made me think.

Wouldn’t it be nice to have a President that actually read something, could comprehend what he or she read, and also give a coherent argument either for or against?

I think it would be nice.
