>Welcome to Manufacturing Day. The world of production has changed remarkably in recent years. Manufacturing plants are now clean and relatively quiet.
>
>When I was young and growing up in the Detroit area, manufacturing jobs were easy to come by. They paid very well, but they were hard on the body and soul. The work was repetitive, the plant factory was loud, the smell was heavy with grease, and there were physical dangers if you weren’t careful. I lost the tip of a thumb to a small stamp welder.
>
>Now when you’re employed in manufacturing, you’re likely to work in a clean environment with minimal ambient noise. Safety has improved as well as the opportunities for non-repetitive work. Robots do much of the heavy lifting. These are good days to work in manufacturing.
>
>And the pay is still decent. These slides tell the story of the country’s best cities for manufacturing engineer wages according to ZipRecruiter. The average pay nationally is $75,415.

Just an FYI for all you budding engineers out there. America is still very good at making things and the environment is better than ever.
