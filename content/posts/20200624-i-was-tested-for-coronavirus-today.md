Last Friday an employee where I work became sick and was diagnosed with coronavirus. I was on vacation at the time and do not work directly with the affected person. We began work from home for all employees that could in late February. We have social distancing rules, PPE requirements, and have increased our sanitation. We also had a plan for dealing with an infection. On Saturday the first round of employees were being tested and on Tuesday the first results were back. Unfortunately, the tests showed that more people required testing. I was in this group.

Test sites are plentiful in the greater Houston area, but wait times are long. I arrived when the testing center opened at 8:00 this morning. I was given a paper with a QR code for check-in. I was done in about 10 minutes and received my reservation (between 12:00 and 2:00). At 1:30 I received a test via nasal swab and at 2:00 I was on the way home. The test was quick and painless. I should have a result in 2-3 days.

Hopefully, I'll get a negative result and this will be the end of the story.
