On June 23 Senators Graham, Cotton, and Blackburn introduced a [bill][1] that they claim will "bolster national security interests and better protect communities across the country by ending the use of 'warrant-proof' encrypted technology by terrorists and other bad actors to conceal illicit behavior."

In fact the bill will do none of those things. It will greatly reduce every American's privacy and make it easier for terrorists and other bad actors to harm Americans.

The authors claim,

>The Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act is a balanced solution that keeps in mind the constitutional rights afforded to all Americans, while providing law enforcement the tools needed to protect the public from everyday violent crime and threats to our national security. The bill would require service providers and device manufacturers to provide assistance to law enforcement when access to encrypted devices or data is necessary – **but only after** a court issues a warrant, based on probable cause that a crime has occurred, authorizing law enforcement to search and seize the data.  

If this is true and is the full extent of the bill then there is no need for it. Existing law already works this way. In the introduction to the bill Senator Cotton states his true objective.

>“Tech companies’ increasing reliance on encryption has turned their platforms into a new, lawless playground of criminal activity. Criminals from child predators to terrorists are taking full advantage. This bill will ensure law enforcement can access encrypted material with a warrant based on probable cause and help put an end to the Wild West of crime on the Internet,”

I have heard enough from Senator Cotton to know that he doesn't understand encryption. There are three ways to acheive his goal. 

- Weak encryption can be used by manufacturers. Then it can be easily broken by law enforcement and other criminals (I meant it the way I wrote it). 
- A backdoor can be left in the system. This defeats the purpose of encryption. Backdoors for good guys are back doors for bad guys too. 
- Device manufacturers can maintain keys in order to decrypt user data. They will quickly find themself without a market and even if they retain customers there is a wider attack vector for bad actors.

This is a useless argument by government. Outlawing encryption is tantamount to outlawing mathematics. They can force corporations in the United States to comply but that does not solve their "terrorist" problem. Computers and mobile phones can, will, and are manufactured throughout the world. Encryption will be available and new methods of encrypting data will be developed. This isn't about protection of citizens. It is about power. Don't be fooled. Losing encryption is an assault on your First Amendment Rights.
