I made some much needed upgrades to my workspace recently. Last week I took delivery of a new belt printer, the Creality CR-30. My current workspace was a mess. I added a new chair. It is a Steelcase Series 1. I use an Eames Aluminum Series chair at work. I find this chair to be more comfortable although not nearly as stylish. I also added two electric standing desks from Fezibo. They are solid, hold my dual monitors well, and provide a nice workspace for hobbies. There is a bit more work to do but this setup will serve me well for some time.

In January I upgraded my work PC to an Apple Mac Mini (M1). It replaced a six year old Dell Optiplex. The difference cannot be explained. I was extremely impressed and thought about purchasing one for home as well. I've been working on a laptop at home since 2012. I used a 2012 15" rMBP for five years and then upgraded to a 2015 15" rMBP. I considered waiting for a larger MacBook Pro (M1) but I realized that at home I am better served by a desktop. I bought a Mac Mini (M1) for home. It's a wonderful computer. 

It's hard to explain how much better the M1 is. I've heard many comparisons and read all the benchmarks. Granted, I use my computers for a long time, but I haven't noticed a jump in performance this big since the early 00's. Saying this is a fast computer is an understatement. It wakes like an iPhone. It runs emulated x86 code faster than my old Intel Macs can run natively. The fan never spins up even when rendering complex 3D files or slicing extremely large models for my printers. 

I love having an always on solution that never requires charging. Mobility is nice, but in an office setting power is better. Of course it seems that you don't have to sacrifice power for mobility with the M1. I'm sure I'll upgrade my laptop later this year or early next year, but I don't think I'll give up the desktop lifestyle anytime soon.

There are a few pieces of software that I can't run. All of them are open-source betas for 3D printing. They are niche products and the kinks will be worked out soon enough. Everything mainstream just works. If you are in the Apple ecosystem I can't come up with a reason why you shouldn't own an M1 based Mac. These Mac Mini's are far and away the best computers I've ever owned.
