Yesterday Prusa released a major update to the printer drivers for the MK3S/MK2.5S/MMU2S. This release is recommended for everyone. You can download it [directly from Prusa][1].  Full release notes are on the project [github][2]. You can install using [PrusaSlicer][3]. The process should be seemless and take less than 5 minutes.
