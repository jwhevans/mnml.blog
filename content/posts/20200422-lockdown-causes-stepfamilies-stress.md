This story from [The Financial Times][1] may be behind a paywall for some readers.  By the way, I'm technically breaking FT's terms and conditions by helping to increase their reach.

>As coronavirus lockdown rules came into force, one friend confessed to a quandary. She could not decide whether to include her father in the new family WhatsApp group, created to cheer up relatives scattered across different countries and keep them up to date on each other’s health. The dilemma was not due to animosity. Just the opposite; she spoke to her dad regularly. Rather, it was because her mother’s new partner was on the group. The men had never met. In the end she decided against adding him.

As a divorced father I can attest to the difficulties that the current epidemic causes. In some cases it easier to let things go that would have caused animosity in the past. Given the current situation, I find myself more empathetic. However, finding the correct balance is hard. I want my kids to be safe. I want them to be healthy. I want to reduce their chances of getting this disease and of transmitting it to others. As a split family we necessarily increase our children's exposure.

Everyone will need to deal with these issues. It just comes with added difficulty for those of us in split families. I know my ex-wife has the children's best interests in mind always. I believe I do as well, but we have never been able to agree on what that means. Somehow, we must navigate this current situation. I try to do that with empathy, but if that means not seeing my children the emotional burden is high.

I'm thankful that I've been able to work out a solution via FaceTime calls and an adjusted custody schedule after this is over. The big question is, when is this over?
