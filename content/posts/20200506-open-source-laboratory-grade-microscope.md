Many open source 3D printed projects fail to meet the requirements necessary for use in "the real world". This development from The University of Bath is different. They have created a printable laboratory grade microscope and the cost of materials can be as low as $18 USD.

>[The OpenFlexure Microscope, described in Biomedical Optics Express, is a fully automated, laboratory-grade instrument with motorised sample positioning and focus control. It is unique among 3-D-printed microscopes in its ability to yield high-quality images. It has been designed to be easy to use, with an intuitive software interface and simplified alignment procedures. It is also highly customisable, meaning it can be adapted for laboratory, school and home use.][1]
