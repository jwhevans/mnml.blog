In a post to Slashdot, msmash states:

>[Apple is researching keyboards with small displays on the keys to dynamically change the label on each key, according to a newly-granted patent filing.](https://apple.slashdot.org/story/20/12/29/1825241/apple-researching-keyboards-with-adaptive-displays-on-each-key?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed)

I donâ€™t care much for the touch bar but this would be useful. I would like the ability to change my keyboard layout and actually see the keys remap. It could also be beneficial if the keys mapped differently for different operating systems and/or programs.<!--more-->
