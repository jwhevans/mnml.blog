📚 Currently reading [“Burn-In: A Novel of the Real Robotic Revolution”][1]. It starts out slow but becomes interesting after about 70 pages. If you are like me you will spend hours checking the footnotes and then going down the internet rabbit hole. So much of the tech in this book is already available today.
