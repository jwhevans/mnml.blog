>Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) frequently does impressive work with 3D printing materials, including metamaterials. Now the lab has introduced a new class of metamaterial that can almost instantly respond and stiffen 3D printed structures when exposed to a magnetic field.

Metamaterials are an interesting technology. I've been quite interested in applications for smart materials for many years. The ability to add feedback within a design and/or structure to adapt on the fly to changing external conditions allows for an entire new class of designs. All of these technologies, e.g. SMA's, continue to improve, but I feel we are far from integration on an industrial scale.
