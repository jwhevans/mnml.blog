📚 My sister sent me a few books for Christmas. I’ve been reading through the short stories in Bill O’Neill’s [“Interesting Stories for Curious People”](https://bookshop.org/a/11073/9781648450440). It’s just a fun book of random facts. For example, many people are still taught in grade school that Columbus could not secure funding for an Atlantic crossing to “Asia” because people believed the earth was flat. That is entirely false. Ptolemy had produced modern style spherical maps with latitude and longitude in the 5th Century CE. Though lost for a time, these maps were common knowledge and widely accepted in Columbus’ day. You will know many of the things in this book. Still it’s fun for friends and family.<!--more-->
