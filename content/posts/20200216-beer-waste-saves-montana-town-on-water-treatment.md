I worked on project that turned sludge from tail water pits into fertilizer. It had the potential to save significant sums of money but also suffered from logistics challenges. Sludges are wet and therefore heavy.

It seems that this could be addressed through city planners and zoning. My local brewery is close to one of our water treatment facilities but not so close that they could be connected easily by a shared piping system. Placing them closer together could significantly reduce transport costs.
