I received my iPad Magic Keyboard today and I’m writing this review on it. I bought the original iPad on the day it was released 10 years ago. I downloaded apps and wrote software. I tried everything possible to make it my daily driver. I gave up on it and went back to my Mac. The original iPad became a gaming device for the children and after it stopped receiving updates it became a YouTube viewer. I was not tempted to purchase another iPad until the 11” iPad Pro was released. I jumped at a good deal from Amazon last year for the iPad and the Smart Keyboard Folio.  I’ve been using it regularly since that time.

I have lost the urge to make the iPad my daily computer. I have come to realize that computers are not different than any other tools. With tools, specialization is important. Multitools are nice in a pinch, but a true craftsman has many tools and those tools are purpose built. So my main workhorse is still a mid-2015 15” Retina MacBook Pro. The iPad Pro is a very capable tool in its own right and is taking over more of my computing tasks.

## Unboxing

As with all Apple products there is not much to say here. The packaging is exquisite. It is a joy to open anything Apple makes. Pull tabs are accessible and easily visible. There is no fumbling with plastic wrap and when the box is removed the device is ready to go.

## Setup

This is an accessory and it comes ready to go. Power is provided by the iPad itself through the smart keyboard connector. This also provides the data link between the keyboard and iPad. This is a subtle but important design choice. The Magic Keyboard does not use Bluetooth. Because of this the iPad can be removed from the keyboard and the on-screen keyboard is immediately usable. If you have used Bluetooth keyboards with your iPad previously, I think you will appreciate the difference.

To get up and running you simply open the keyboard and attach the iPad. Magnets snap everything in to place perfectly. The setup is necessarily top heavy so you will need to place a finger on the lower half of the keyboard when opening.

## Design and Build

I wouldn’t expect less, but I must state that this is a quality product. It is immediately clear that it was purpose built and designed to last. It is heavy. That is a necessary compromise for this use case. The iPad is light relative to a laptop, but it achieves that lightness by eschewing the keyboard. I have read some reviews complaining about the weight, but I don’t see it as a problem. When I work in laptop mode weight does not matter. When I want a lighter experience I can grab the iPad and go. For reference, my 11” iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil weight 1075g. My 15” MacBook Pro is 1970g.

In my opinion, the keys on the Magic Keyboard are significantly better to type on than on the Smart Keyboard Folio. I appreciate the design and lightness of the Smart Keyboard Folio but I’ve never loved the typing experience. The keys were too small for my hands and I hated the arrow key layout. The Magic Keyboard is not going to become my favorite keyboard. The overall size is still too small on an 11” iPad, but the feel and sound of the keys is excellent.  Key travel is great. Key size is perfect. I can type as fast as I do on my daily system and am just as accurate.

The keyboard also provides backlighting on the keys. I know this is a big plus for some people. I don’t really care. I turned it down significantly and it’s just fine.

The trackpad feels nice and is very “clicky”. Apple always makes great trackpads and this is no exception. The addition of the trackpad makes the iPad a much more capable device (again in my opinion). The trackpad is much smaller than the trackpads on Apple’s laptop line. Am I alone in thinking that they have gone overboard with trackpad sizes though. I don’t feel cramped for space with this trackpad at all.

## Software and Use

It is not possible to review the iPad Magic Keyboard without the context of iOS 13.4. The iPad has been a technically capable device for some time, but software support has hindered its use cases for me. That is no longer the case. The support for pointing devices that was released in iOS 13.4 is phenomenal. Cursors work in a very iPad like way. Cursor and gesture support are intuitive. The ability to cut, copy, paste, drag ‘n drop particularly in spreadsheets is very nice. I often turn to my iPad for email and other short form writing. I love it for drawing and for document markups. Spreadsheet work and long-form writing always push me back to the Mac. That will not change entirely, again because of software limitations. The hardware and basic software support is no longer the issue.

## Conclusion

The addition of the Magic Keyboard to my iPad turns it into a device that is much more capable for the type of work that I do and will allow me to travel for short periods without a MacBook. Ergonomics dictate that an 11” iPad Pro is not going to be my daily workhorse, and unless certain restrictions are lifted I don’t expect all the software I need to exist on the iPad. In only one day of use I can tell that this is an excellent accessory that will increase my use of and productivity on an iPad.

Should you buy one? If you use your device for media consumption only or primarily then I believe it is two expensive. If you type on your device regularly or you use the iPad as your main device, even occasionally, then I believe you would benefit.
