The always great [Kottke.org][1] posts that PBS is streaming a new Ken Burns documentary based on the book "The Gene: An Intimate History," by Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee.

I have read the book. It is excellent. The trailer and promo for the documentary look great as well. I will definitely watch.

[Part 1 is streaming now.][2] Part 2 should stream next week.
