The economic fallout from the coronavirus epidemic is far from over. Texas is in a better fiscal position than some states due to a large 'rainy day fund'. The legislature has stated that they will not use this fund until next year. 

That may prove difficult. Missing tax receipts and a continued slowdown in the oil market are going to take their toll over time. This was a shockwave across the economy. [The Texas Tribune][1] reports that the unemployment rate in Texas was 12.8% at the end of April. This surpasses the previous high of 9.2% in 1986. The rate was 4.7% in March. Some other figures to note:

- New unemployment claims week ended May 16: 134,381
- Sales tax collected: $2.6 billion (down 9.3% year over year)

These numbers are 3-4 times as bad as the 2008 recession and the disruption caused by Hurrican Harvey in 2017.
