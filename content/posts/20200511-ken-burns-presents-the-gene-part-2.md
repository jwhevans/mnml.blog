I finished part 2 of the Ken Burns documentary [*The Gene: An Intimate History*][1]. The film covers topics that are not in the book and presents the personal stories of several people affected by genetic ailments and the potential cures that genetic medicine may bring. I recommend this to anyone that has a general interest in genetic medicine.
