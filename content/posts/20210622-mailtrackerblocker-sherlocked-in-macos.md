This month Apple announced that starting with macOS 12 mail.app will block tracking pixels in emails by default. This is a great feature. It was possible to do this using 3rd party plugins as I posted [before][1]. Unfortunately, these apps have all been “sherlocked”. If you develop anything in the privacy space right now you can bet that Apple will make your idea part of the system soon.
