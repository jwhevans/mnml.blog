The [Van Gogh Museum][1] in Amsterdam is closed during the pandemic but they have posted videos online to give you an introduction. I went on a "social distancing date" with my girlfriend last week via these videos. I have never visited the museum in person. 15 minutes is enough time to know that I must see it someday.
