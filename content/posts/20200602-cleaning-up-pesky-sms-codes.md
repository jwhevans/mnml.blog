I guess that most people receive SMS from multiple companies. They may be one-time passcodes, bank fraud alerts, notifications, or marketing. I don’t like a long list of random conversations in iMessage. I also don’t like to manually delete conversations regularly to keep the timeline clean. To fix this I created and maintain one contact named ‘SMS Codes’. Every time I receive an SMS from a new company I add their number to this contact. Then all of these items are neatly grouped into one conversation. I think I learned this on an episode of [ATP][1].
