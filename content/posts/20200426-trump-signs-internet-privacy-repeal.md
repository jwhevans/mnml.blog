[The Hill][1] reported in 2017 that President Trump used the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to repeal internet privacy rules put in place under the Obama administration. The CRA had been used successfully once before by former President George W. Bush. Trump used it more than 10 times to utterly gut policies put in place by former President Obama.

This story is now 3 years old, but Congress has not taken action to rectify the situation despite the fact that there is no public support for reducing internet privacy. Our Congress does not have our best interests at heart. Their true constituents are the corporations that benefit from having access to our data.

I believe a reasonable expectation of privacy is a fundamental right. Our ability to decide what part of our lives remains private is eroding and that is not healthy for democracy. If we expect freedom to speak out against government, to meet peaceably, to worship as we choose, we must stand up for strong privacy protections. If we have no expectation of privacy the 1<sup>st</sup> Amendment loses its power.

Despite quick criticism of the decision, this issue became lost in the never-ending circus that characterizes this administration. Even though some Democrats used the decision as a way to differentiate themselves and win vulnerable seats in the mid-term elections, they are beholden to the same powers that drove the decision.

For me it is clear that we are in a battle to maintain our privacy. I believe privacy is the most fundamental of rights. I believe our ability to live in a public society, to have free and open public discourse, to pursue life and liberty depend heavily on our ability to separate those things that we deem private from those things that we wish to present publicly.

We need a change in our system of governance. Representative democracy was always a compromise. It was necessary in order to ratify a constitution comprised of states with vast differences in resources, human capital, and allegiances with their former sovereign government. We tend to give the founder's of our democracy more credit than they deserve. One thing that they did right was recognize that the constitution they drafted was a product of its time and circumstance. They built a way to change it, and they changed it soon after it was enacted.

We change The Constitution of the United States rarely. There is good reason for this. Read the constitution as a historical document and it is clear that it was designed to protect the rule of wealthy white male land-owners. Today Congressional leaders such as Mitch McConnell still fight for this ideal. The times have changed but the politics have not. A government that primarily guarantees its freedoms to a minority aristocracy is not a representative democracy. It is just oligarchy with a good PR campaign.

It isn't enough for us to elect new leadership. We need to push for reforms to the system. We need a new set of compromises that reflect the world of 2020. We are no longer an upstart disparate band of colonies fighting against taxation from afar. This is an economically mature country. It is in fact, the richest nation in the history of the world. We have vast resources and human capital and a unique entrepreneurial spirit.

We need a politics that gives voice to the people. It must speak as loud for women as it does for men. It must acknowledge that the descendants of people brought here illegally for years, were born here and are citizens of this nation in every respect, with the same value and expectation of liberty as anyone else. It must value an immigrant mother working two jobs and staying up late to ensure her kids are fed and do their homework at least as much, if not more, than it values the corner offices of Wall Street.

Protecting our privacy is fundamental to these changes, but only a first step. We need to ensure that we can take the first step. Information is the power that minorities use to keep control of the majority. Look to the vast data gathering apparatus of Germany during the 1930s and 1940s. Look to the surveillance state in China today. What is to stop 1.2 billion people from throwing off the rule of the communist party. If they choose, nothing can stop them. There are simply too many people, but information and strong preemptive action by a minority is extremely effective. We have come together before to throw off tyranny and form a more perfect union. It is time to do that again.
