I ran across a link to the work of photo restoration specialist DutchSteamMachine via this [SlashDot article][1]. In his spare time he uses a technique called [Depth-Aware video frame INterpolation][2] (DAIN) to enhance low frame rate videos from the Apollo program. The original videos were taken at 6 or 12 frames per second. After enhancement they are presented at 24 or 60 frames per second. It should be noted that the additional frames are not real. They are interpolations and approximations based on the best guesses of the algorithm. As such some videos are better than others. The video embedded below is absolutely stunning. In my mind it does for the moon landing videos what [these images][3] do for moon photography. Check out DutchSteamMachinesâ€™ [Youtube channel][4] for more of his work.
