Forty years ago 3D printing was in its infancy. SLA was the primary method of printing. It was a niche process that could provide rapid prototypes but at high cost and relatively low quality. New technologies have been developed and improved over time. FFM, FDM, laser sintering, and others have broadened the uses of 3D printing and have made it possible to use more materials. The past 20 years have seen rapid growth in the use of 3D printed processes for industrial use. Advances in material science and cost reductions in equipment are the primary drivers behind this adoption. 

3D printing is used widely in industry today but its growth is still hindered by the properties of materials. 3D printed parts are weak at the interface between their individual layers. Sometimes a designer can work around this shortcoming with clever infill or print direction. Often there is no way around the weakness and a different production method must be used.

Texas A&M University performs a significant amount of research around 3D printing processes and 3D printing materials. In a new paper, '[Dielectric Barrier Discharge Applicator for Heating Carbon Nanotube-Loaded Interfaces and Enhancing 3D Printing Bond Strength][1]', the authors present a novel method of heat treating individual layers during a print. This increases the overall bond strength.

Hobbyist's and professional's alike will know that heat treatment is often used to adjust the properties of a material for a specific purpose. Heat treatment of steels is well known. Steels undergo heat treatment to increase or decrease surface hardness, to make them more or less malleable, and to change their tensile strength. Heat treatment can be used on plastic components as well. Many a 3D printing hobbyist has used a heat gun to clean up or weld a print. This can work well but it is hard to control and can also ruin the part.

The key to the technology developed at Texas A&M is the ability to control the heat applied to the part and to localize the heating to the current working layer.

>Using a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma electrode that can be mounted on the 3D printer for welding of parts, the researchers were able to create parts strong enough to compare with traditionally created injection-molded parts.

With this technique the researchers have narrowed the gap between the strength of 3D printed parts and injection molded parts. That will open up more opportunities for 3D printed parts in industry.
