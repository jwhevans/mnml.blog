Another report from [OilPrice.com][1]. This time by Julianne Gieger

>The price of natural gas fell nearly 5% on Monday, as lower U.S. LNG exports threaten to exacerbate inventories, which are already significantly higher than the five-year average.

Last weekâ€™s exports were the lowest in four years. At that time there was only one LNG export terminal in the United States. Currently, there are five LNG terminals operating in the lower 48 according to [tankterminals.com][2]. I expect to see an increase in the bankruptcy rate of drillers as the oil and gas sector sheds debt.
