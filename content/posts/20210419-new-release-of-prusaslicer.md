The latest release of PrusaSlicer 2.3.1 is available on [GitHub][1] with native Apple M1 support. Iâ€™ve tested it on some of my large 3mf files and it is noticeably faster and more stable than the previous version.  

>This a final release of PrusaSlicer 2.3.1, introducing native builds for the new Apple Silicon MacBooks, Chrome OS support, performance improvements in G-code rendering, security fixes and new 3rd party printer profiles.
