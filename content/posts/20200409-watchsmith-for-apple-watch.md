_DavidSmith, the creator of many great iOS and watchOS apps [announced a new app, Watchsmith][1].

>For the last five and a half years I’ve been enamored with developing for the Apple Watch. I’ve made workout apps, weather apps, calendar apps, health apps, news apps, audio apps, astronomy apps and games. With each app I’ve learned a lot about what makes a good watch app and also built up a wide library of code and tools for making them.
>
>With this in mind I immediately started planning how I could take full advantage of watchOS 6. I didn’t want to simply update my existing apps. I wanted to really swing for the fences and see if I could push the definition of what a “watch app” was. In many ways the result is my Master’s Thesis of watch development, combining all of what I’ve learned over the years into a single, cohesive experience.

I downloaded the app immediately and added two Watchsmith complications to my favorite watch face, Infograph. The app allows significant customizations for the complications. It also makes it possible to change complications based on time of day. This is a great idea and is well executed. If you use several watch faces for different tasks or times then I think you will appreciate this app.
