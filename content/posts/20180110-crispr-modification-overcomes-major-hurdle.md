>ResearchGate: How does CRISPR/Cas9 traditionally work?
>
>Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte: The traditional CRISPR/Cas9 system works by first creating DNA double strand breaks in the targeted region of the genome. However, generating these double strand breaks has the risk of causing unwanted mutations permanently, and this increases the risk of inducing tumors or other genetic diseases in patients. This concern is a hurdle to using CRISPR/Cas9 to treat humans. The risk of causing non-specific mutations is always an issue when using gene-editing tools to treat humans

>Izpisua Belmonte: Our approach maintains the gene targeting property of CRISPR/Cas9, but without generating double strand breaks. It is therefore free of the risk of causing permanent, unwanted mutations in patients.

CRISPR blows my mind. This may not go anywhere but it seems that they have cleared a major hurdle. The rate of progress in the gene editing field is increasing. I expect there will be solid therapies in place for humans within ten years.
