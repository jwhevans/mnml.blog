Two days ago a tweet popped up in my timeline from Ben Stiller. â€œIâ€™m sad to say that my father, Jerry Stiller, passed away from natural causes. He was a great dad and grandfather, and the most dedicated husband to Anne for about 62 years. He will be greatly missed. Love you Dad."

I got so many laughs watching Jerry Stiller over the years. "A Festivus for the Restivus" ðŸ˜‚ I know him primarily as George's dad on Seinfeld. There are so many funny moments in that series. He lived a long life and left quite a legacy.
