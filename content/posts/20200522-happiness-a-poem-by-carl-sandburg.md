*- Carl Sandburg*

I ASKED the professors who teach the meaning of life to tell  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me what is happiness.

And I went to famous executives who boss the work of  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousands of men.

They all shook their heads and gave me a smile as though  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was trying to fool with them

And then one Sunday afternoon I wandered out along  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Desplaines river  

And I saw a crowd of Hungarians under the trees with  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their women and children and a keg of beer and an  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accordion.
