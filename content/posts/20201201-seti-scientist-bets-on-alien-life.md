From [The Debrief][1]

>SETI astronomer and astrophysicist Seth Shostak is convinced that humans will become aware of an intelligent extraterrestrial civilization by 2036. If he is wrong, he will buy you a Starbucks coffee. 

I’m surprised we haven’t found one already. There is more and more evidence of life in the solar system. I expect we find microbial life in the next 10 years on other planets.
