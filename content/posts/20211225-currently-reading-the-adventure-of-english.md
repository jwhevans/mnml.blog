ðŸ“š Currently reading ["The Adventure of English: The Biography of a Language"](https://bookshop.org/a/11073/9781611450071) by Melvyn Bragg. If you are the type of person that owns an Oxford unabridged dictionary or can spend the better part of an afternoon reading about the etymology of your favorite words then this book is for you. It's a lay-persons history of the English language from its Germanic roots in the 5th century to present day.
