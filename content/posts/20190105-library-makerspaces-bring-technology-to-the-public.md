[3dprint.com][1] ran a post on the rise of 3D printers and Makerspaces at public libraries.

>Libraries are some of my favorite places, and I know I’m not alone in that sentiment. The obvious reason for that is that they’re full of books, but they’re so much more than that, too. They’re quiet places of respite, while simultaneously being places that embrace community. And the rise of technology hasn’t diminished their relevance at all – quite the opposite, actually. Libraries have always been the first access point to new technology for a lot of people. I can actually remember using the Internet for the first time at my school library, opening up a browser window and not having any idea how to navigate past the library’s home page. That’s kind of laughable to think about now, but how many people had that same experience as their first exposure to the Internet?

I agree with everything in this post. I love libraries and thankfully my children enjoy the library as well. It is a well established tradition in our house that we visit the local library every other Saturday.

[Our library][2] offers the standard fare of amenities and programs, from children’s story time to adult writing workshops, books and various media. They also allow patrons to borrow board games. This is absolutely fabulous.

Recently they added a 3D printer. It is a simple system with a single extruder, but that is more than sufficient to make a huge range of parts. It’s a great system for both adults and kids to learn on. There is no reason to start printing on a dual extruder system. It’s too complex and even seasoned designers need practice with a system before they start to get good prints.

I’m amazed at what people make. There are many good prints. Of course, [Thingiverse][3], and other online repositories make this easier, but the point is that it’s available to people and it’s affordable.

A membership at my local [Makerspace][4] is $50/month, and a full bench is $145/month. That isn’t unreasonable but it is more than most people could afford. A membership gets you access to a printer although you still need to pay for supplies and time. At the library a print is $0.07/g and $1.00/hour over 4 hours. At that price I believe our library is truly democratizing learning.
