[The Verge][1] reports that Walmart is converting parking lots into drive-in movie theaters starting this August.

>The retail behemoth is converting 160 of its parking lots across the US into drive-ins. These theaters will open in early August and remain open through October. The Walmart Drive-In will feature movies programmed by Tribeca Enterprises, the company behind the Tribeca Film Festival, which recently launched a summer movie drive-in series bringing films, music, and sporting events to as many US drive-ins as possible.

It’s an interesting idea. I haven’t been to a drive-in movie in years.
