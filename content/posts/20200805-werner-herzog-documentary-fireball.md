[MacRumors][1] reported last week that Apple TV+ has acquired the rights to Werner Herzog’s upcoming documentary “Fireball”.

>"Fireball" explores the cultural and physical influence that meteors, comets, and deep impacts have had on Earth in regard to mythology, religion, and human imagination.

I’m looking forward to this.
