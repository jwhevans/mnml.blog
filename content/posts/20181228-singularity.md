*(after Stephen Hawking)*

Do you sometimes want to wake up to the singularity  
we once were?

so compact nobody  
needed a bed, or food or money —

nobody hiding in the school bathroom  
or home alone

pulling open the drawer  
where the pills are kept.

For every atom belonging to me as good  
Belongs to you.   Remember?

There was no&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;No  
&nbsp;them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No tests

to determine if the elephant  
grieves her calf &nbsp;&nbsp;or if

the coral reef feels pain.&nbsp;&nbsp;Trashed  
oceans don’t speak English or Farsi or French;

would that we could wake up&nbsp;&nbsp;to what we were  
— when we were ocean&nbsp;&nbsp;and before that

to when sky was earth, and animal was energy,  
and rock was liquid and stars were space  
and space was not

at all — nothing

before we came to believe humans were so important  
before this awful loneliness.

Can molecules recall it?  
what once was?&nbsp;&nbsp;before anything happened?

No I, no We, no one. No was  
No verb&nbsp;&nbsp;no noun  
only a tiny tiny dot brimming with  
is is is is is

All&nbsp;&nbsp;everything&nbsp;&nbsp;home
