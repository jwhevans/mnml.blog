[The Verge][1], [Marketplace][2], and numerous others noted recently that the extended copyright protections passed in 1998 ran out yesterday and a new batch of works, these from 1923, enter the public domain today.

From [The Center for the Study of the Public Domain][3]

>For the first time in over 20 years, on January 1, 2019, published works will enter the US public domain.1 Works from 1923 will be free for all to use and build upon, without permission or fee. They include dramatic films such as The Ten Commandments, and comedies featuring Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and Harold Lloyd. There are literary works by Robert Frost, Aldous Huxley, and Edith Wharton, the “Charleston” song, and more. And remember, this has not happened for over 20 years. Why? Works from 1923 were set to go into the public domain in 1999, after a 75-year copyright term. But in 1998 Congress hit a two-decade pause button and extended their copyright term for 20 years, giving works published between 1923 and 1977 an expanded term of 95 years.

They have a nice set of links and write-ups regarding the history of public domain as well.
