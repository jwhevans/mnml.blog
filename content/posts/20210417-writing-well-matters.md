Of all the things I learned in school the one I use the most and the one that has been most critical to my success is writing. Writing is essential to work because all work is, at its heart, communication. Being able to communicate effectively is a strong advantage. While writing is not the only form of communication it is the foundation for all effective communication. In my experience, the strongest writers are also the strongest presenters, and even visual designers benefit from the ability to write well.

I consider myself a strong writer. I am not a professional. If you follow this blog you may disagree. My process here is haphazard. I let ideas flow unstructured. I capture fleeting thoughts. In my work life I need to provide precise direction and to create documentation that is clear, correct, and lasting.

The pandemic caused many of us to work remotely for the first time or more often than previously. That made communication more important. My team communicated via Microsoft Teams extensively this year. This is a chat type experience where the ability to write concicely was valuable. We also leaned on email more than normal. Email can be a very strong tool when used as it should be, asyncronously. I also learned that I can smooth workflows by regularly providing long-form written decision papers. Documented procedures and standard operating procedures are well known and are effective. We have these but I can multiply my effectiveness when making a decision by documenting my decision and my rationale for the decision in a formal paper. This helps me to make better decisions and also gives my team a view into my mind. They can use this later to move forward without input from me.

Regardless of your age or position I recommend that you make effort to improve your writing. It will serve your well in school, work, and life. There are many tools to help you improve your writing. [This article][1] is a good start. "The Elements of Style" by Strunk and White is a classic and recommended for everyone's library. Finally, practice. The more you write the better you will become. Start documenting everything. Share it and ask for criticism. You'll be glad you did.
