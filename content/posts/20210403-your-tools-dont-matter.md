In a great post last month, George Stocker makes a point that resonates with me, ["No one gives a shit what programming language you use"][1].

>In another example of this performative culture of software craftsmanship, and I’ll use wood-working as an example because I grew up in that culture, woodworkers take pride in the finished product, and seeing that finish product being used. They are not all hot on the tools they use, and nor do they value the art of planing for its own sake. No, it’s always in furtherance of the ultimate goal: to produce something another human will enjoy using.

Maybe it was the way I was raised, maybe it is my training as a mechanical engineer, or maybe it my career in production, but I am also completely annoyed when tools are exalted above the product. Tools are our path to product. Certain tools can help us to acheive better tolerances, better cost, or quality but in the end this is only possible through the use of the tool. Nothing comes for free. 

I don't care if our designers program machines in native gcode, conversational programming, or CAD/CAM. We have a product specification and customer expectations. I also don't care what programming languages are used by our teams to improve their processes. The technology stack is not the important issue. Meeting customer expectations effectively is. I'm comfortable with Python. Employee A is an Excel genius. Solidworks is the company standard but Employee B can output designs twice as fast in OpenSCAD. Why should I care?

No one way is the way. We all develop workflows. So long as they are accurate and effective, they are the correct workflow.
