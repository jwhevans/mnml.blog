Via [CNBC][1] back in May

>Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said long-term investors of Apple's stock shouldn't obsess with near-term iPhone sales...

Buffett revealed that Berkshire bought an astounding 75 million shares of Apple during the first quarter. That adds to the 165.3 million shares Berkshire already owned at the end of 2017... I’m willing to bet they are buying a lot more right now. I’m also going to venture a guess that Apple has bought back a near record number of shares this quarter.

>Apple has "a wide, wide gap. I mean it's an amazing business," Buffett told CNBC's Becky Quick. "You can put all of their products on a dining room table.”..."
>
>Nobody buys a farm based on whether they think it's going to rain next year," he added. "They buy it because they think it's a good investment over 10 or 20 years."

With stocks tanking lately, and tech stocks in particular I believe it’s worth remembering this interview with Warren Buffett. Apple has a loyal and engaged customer base. They hold a monopoly status in mindshare even though they have a minority market share, in revenues not profits. I don’t know how Wall Street consistently misses this most important of metrics. Apple’s production system and supply chain are beyond world class.

There is considerable criticism of Apple and rightly so. No company can sit on its laurels and expect to remain a leader. I don’t believe this is the case though. Most complaints have to do with the Mac line and the iPad line. The Mac line is a mature product and quite frankly the design is top notch. I use my Mac(s) day in and day out. They are bullet-proof and they are boring. That is a good thing.

iOS for iPad is a different story. Notice I said iOS. The iPad is an amazing piece of engineering from the silicon, to the display, to the unibody. There are amazing applications and the form factor is a game changer in my world of manufacturing. The problem I find is consistency in the interface of apps and multitasking capabilities, but I digress. These are software problems and all software sucks. I have confidence that Apple and developers will continue to iterate year after year.

Apple’s cash generating machine is not in danger any time soon. Jony Ive said that as long as Apple makes great products and remains operationally competent they will succeed. They are doing that and more. I’m no Buffett but I’m going to buy a little more of Apple while they are getting cheaper.

I’m not qualified to give financial advice and this article should not be taken as such. Investing in stocks involves risk. If you are interested in investing for fun or profit I suggest that you read [“The Intelligent Investor”][2] by Benjamin Graham. In fact just read Chapter 9 “The Defensive Investor” and forget about the rest.
