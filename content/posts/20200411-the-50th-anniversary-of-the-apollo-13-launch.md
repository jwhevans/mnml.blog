[This post in Design News][1] reminded me that today is the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 13 launch. 

>April 11, 2020 is the 50th anniversary of the launch of NASA’s Apollo 13 lunar mission, and this year is also the 25th anniversary of the 1995 film version, directed by Ron Howard. It is this theatrical version of events that is the definitive story of Apollo now for many people, an outcome that was predicted at the time of the movie’s filming by Apollo 15 astronaut Dave Scott, who served as a consultant on the film.

As a profession, engineering does not get much attention on TV and film. While important, most of our work is difficult to dramatize. Attorneys and doctors get all the love. I haven't watch Apollo 13 in 20 years. I'm going to watch it today.
