The United States has held the dubious distinction of being the hardest hit nation by the novel coronavirus this year. The Atlantic is reporting that the numbers in Brazil are rising rapidly and it may become the next hot spot.

>[“Brazil is probably the next epicenter of the pandemic in the world,” Luciano Cesar Azevedo, a physician who has been spending his days and nights treating COVID-19 patients in intensive-care units in São Paulo, the country’s largest city, told me this week. “I think Brazil is going to get close to 100,000 deaths.” On the day we spoke, Azevedo noted that ICU beds in the city’s public health-care system were at 90 percent occupancy. He said Rio de Janeiro, whose health-care system is already seriously strained by the outbreak, could become Brazil’s New York.][1]

Brazil shares some similarities with the United States that could make the situation grim. They have extreme inequality that puts millions at risk. The favelas are densely packed and access to medical care for these areas is poor at best. They also have a leader that is clueless concerning the danger. He has refused to shut down any part of the economy, goes without a mask, and makes a point to shake hands with everyone he meets. I will not be surprised if the United States and Brazil have the most deaths in the world at the end of August.
