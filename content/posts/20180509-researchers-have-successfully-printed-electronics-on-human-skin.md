Interesting piece from [Design News][1]

>Researchers have successfully 3D-printed electronics directly onto human skin using a technique that paves the way for novel applications—not only in wearable electronic technology but also in medicine

>Several aspects of the printing technique developed by the team are integral to its novel function, McAlpine noted. One is that the printer can adjust to small movements of the body during printing by using computer vision...Researchers published a [paper][2] on their work in the journal Advanced Materials.Elizabeth Montalbano is a freelance writer who has written about technology and culture for 20 years. She has lived and worked as a professional journalist in Phoenix, San Francisco, and New York City. She currently resides in a village on the southwest coast of Portugal.

There is enormous potential for 3D printing in medicine but human bodies are a terrible substrate. We just move too much. The fact that this technology can adjust on the fly to movement could be a remarkable leap forward.
