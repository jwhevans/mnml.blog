More and more I believe that intelligence is completely inborn but not predetermined. I believe it is the utilization of a capacity inherent in the mind. I believe that barring some physical disability or trauma, we have a seemingly infinite capacity for learning and understanding. We consider someone as intelligent who has achieved some level of capacity utilization, but the ways and means of expressing this utilization of capacity are so great that we also neglect to see and celebrate so many around us that are profoundly intelligent. I want to cultivate a more open view of intelligence and the wonderful people around me that embody it.
