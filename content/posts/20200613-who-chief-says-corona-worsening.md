[PBS Newshour][1] quoting a report from the Associated Press.

>The head of the World Health Organization warned that the coronavirus pandemic is worsening globally, even as the situation in Europe is improving.

It seems that countries in the Southern Hemisphere are now seeing the most rapid growth in the virus with Brazil showing the highest rates of infection.

>“At the same time, we’re encouraged that several countries around the world are seeing positive signs,” Tedros said. “In these countries, the biggest threat now is complacency.”

This is my biggest concern after the summer months. I am not an expert and have no evidence but anecdotally it seems that cooler, dryer weather increases the transmission rate of the disease. With public health workers expecting an uptick in US cases again this fall I'm afraid we may be hit harder than in March/April.

My primary care physician, who is an expert in cardiovascular disease but not infectious diseases, told me recently that until a vaccine is widely available we should expect coronavirus outbreaks regularly. When I asked about the chances of developing a vaccine, he told me that we have learned a significant amount about vaccine development but it is still a very difficult exercise and we shouldn't expect that one will be found.
