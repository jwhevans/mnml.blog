[From Design News][1]

>35-year-old Ivaylo Josifov was an active, healthy individual who thought he only had a case of tonsillitis when he went to the doctor recently. A chest X-ray, however, showed that he had a growth in the area of his fifth right rib.

Amazing. Doctors were able to give him an exact replica of his damaged rib.
