John Lewis died Friday at the age of 80. He served as a representative to Congress for the State of Georgia from 1986 until his death last week. I am not qualified to write about the man. There are many obituaries of him in the leading papers and there are no doubt biographies to come. Former President Obama said of Mr. Lewis,

>“Generations from now, when parents teach their children what is meant by courage, the story of John Lewis will come to mind — an American who knew that change could not wait for some other person or some other time; whose life is a lesson in the fierce urgency of now.”

For more than half a century John Lewis has been fighting the good fight. He has stood for the oppressed and stood by his principles. In this time of partisan politics, fascist rhetoric, and false patriotism I saw him as a true leader and a real Patriot.

Sometimes I feel like we have come so far since my grandparent’s and parent’s generations. When I see this picture and the thousands like it that have been taken recently I know that we have more to do.
