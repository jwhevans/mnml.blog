Iâ€™ve been a fan of Black Flag, Henry Rollins Band, and Henry Rollins himself for a long time. I like his quotes about eating healthy, working out, and dealing with life. I was thinking about these two recently.

> Half of life is fucking up. The other half is dealing with it.

> Scar tissue is stronger than regular tissue. Realize the strength. Move on.
