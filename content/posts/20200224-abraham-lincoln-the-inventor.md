I previously ruminated on the idea of having a [literate President][2] again. I don't consider patent holding as a job qualification for the U.S. President. Lincoln is a special case, but he is revered for good reason. Being the only President to hold a patent adds one more dimension to this extremely interesting and influential person.

>[Upon hearing the name Abraham Lincoln, many images may come to mind: rail-splitter, country lawyer, young congressman, embattled president, Great Emancipator, assassin's victim, even the colossal face carved into Mount Rushmore. One aspect of this multidimensional man that probably doesn't occur to anyone other than avid readers of Lincoln biographies (and Smithsonian) is that of inventor. Yet before he became the 16th president of the United States, Lincoln, who had a long fascination with how things worked, invented a flotation system for lifting riverboats stuck on sandbars.][1]

The day after I read this a replay of [Engines of Our Ingenuity 3225: Abe Lincoln, Inventor][3] aired on my local NPR station. Time and chance are funny things.
