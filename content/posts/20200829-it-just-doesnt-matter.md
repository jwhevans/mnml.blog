Three years ago this month I suffered a major depressive episode. It was not the first I had experienced, but it was the first time that someone gave it a name. I had battled depression for twenty years previous but I didn’t know or acknowledge it. Psychiatrists currently characterize me as bipolar with major depression and mild mania with an axis of intermittent exposive rage disorder.

It sounds horrible. Sometimes it was. Other times it was extremely useful. Mania can lead to prolific creativity. After my last depressive episode I chose to address my issues with therapy and medicine. Adjusting to medication was hard. I almost stopped. I didn’t feel like myself the first two weeks. My mind seemed to slow down. The thoughts that normally bounced around inside my head slowed to a crawl. I could not talk effectively for two days. My brain felt like it had been wrapped around the center with a rubberband. There was a bottleneck. I would watch a thought form at the back of my brain and as it moved forward it hit the rubberband bottleneck. One word at a time slowly escaped the bottleneck and made its way to my mouth.

Thankfully I didn’t give up. I’ve come to realize that I was addicted to the ups and downs, the wild swings, that are a result of my condition. I loved the highs of a manic fueled week of design, coding, writing, or what have you. The major depressive swings made these good moments stand out even more. After adjusting to medication I came to realize that the swings were more harmful than beneficial. Life lived on an even keel is a better life.

It took some time to adjust. I still haven’t fully. Medicine is not a cure all. Medicine serves as a type of band pass filter for my brain. The highs and lows are muted. I live in a smaller band now. I’m still human though. Life is full of ups and downs. I still get high. I still feel low. I believe that is where the hard work of therapy and self reflection comes to play. I’m beginning to understand that whether things seem to be going great or they seem to be falling apart is irrelevant. It just doesn’t matter. The sun will set on this day. The sun will rise on a new day. 

There is a great parable about a man with a prized horse. The parable takes many forms. I’ll recount a shortened version here.

>A certain man had a prized horse. His neighbor came to him and told him that he was blessed to have such a wonderful animal. The man told the neighbor, “it is neither a blessing nor a curse. It is just an animal.” Shortly thereafter the horse disappeared. The neighbor came again and told the man that it was a shame that he lost his prized horse. The man again replied “things come into your life and things leave your life. It is neither a blessing nor a curse.” After a few days the horse returned leading seventeen beautiful wild horses. The neighbor was amazed and told the man again that he had received a great blessing. The man responded, “Who is to say what is a blessing or a curse? All I can say is that I now have eighteen horses.” Two days later the man’s son was thrown while breaking one of wild horses. His leg was shattered. The neighbor commented on what a tragedy this was. The man told him that he could not comment on whether this was a tragedy. It was simply circumstance. Several weeks later war broke out in the country and the government began a draft. The man’s son was spared the draft because of his broken leg. The neighbor came again and commented on the man’s luck that his son was spared. Again the man said, “It is not luck. It is not a blessing. Who can say what is a blessing or a curse.”

This story can go on forever. In fact it does go on forever playing out in each of our lives. People enter our lives. People leave our lives. We feel pleasure and pain. We experience joy, anger, disgust, fear, sadness. Everything passes. Nothing stays the same. Nothing remains. It is difficult but we can free ourselves to live more fully by letting go of the need to attach meaning to every moment of our lives. Letting go of the idea that every moment must have meaning doesn’t lessen the importance of our life or our interactions with our loved ones. It is simply an acknowledgement that life and all the moments it entails are ephemeral. Good or bad, each moment will pass. Life is nothing more than future crashing into past, expectations becoming history. We live in that ephemeral moment between the two worlds, that thing we call the present.

It is the work of a lifetime to be present. I’m far from perfect. I still let the ups and downs tug me away from the moment. I keep trying though. I get up everyday with a new sunrise. I put my pants on one leg at a time and I keep going forward one step at a time.
