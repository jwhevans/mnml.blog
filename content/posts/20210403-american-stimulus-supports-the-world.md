The New York Times says ["America's Record-Setting Stimulus Could Power a Rebound in Other Countries"][1]. *possibly behind a paywall*

>Global forecasters are predicting that the United States and its record-setting stimulus spending could help haul a weakened Europe and struggling developing countries out of their own economic morass, especially when paired with a rapid vaccine rollout that has poised the U.S. economy for a faster recovery.

As goes the United States, so goes the world. I'm happy to see us as a positive force again.
