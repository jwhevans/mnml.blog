Apple announced a virtual only event for next Tuesday at 10 am Pacific. I wouldn’t read too much into the name, but I think it’s a good guess that “Time Flies” refers to the Apple Watch and iPhones won’t be announced yet. That’s cool. I enjoyed virtual WWDC and having two fall events will be nice. I haven’t upgraded my phone in a long time. I’m using a jet black iPhone 7. I love the jet black finish. I wish it would make a comeback. I will definitely upgrade this year though. If a 5.4” iPhone 12 is announced I’ll preorder immediately. If not then I’m getting an iPhone SE.
