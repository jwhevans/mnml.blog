This is a great longform read from [Popular Mechanics][1] about the history of steel production.

>On a day lost to history, some fortuitous humans found a glistening meteorite, mostly iron and nickel, that had barreled through the atmosphere and crashed into the ground. Thus began an obsession that gripped the species. Over the millennia, our ancestors would work the material, discovering better ways to draw iron from the Earth itself and eventually to smelt it into steel. Weâ€™d fight over it, create and destroy nations with it, grow global economies by it, and use it to build some of the greatest inventions and structures the world has ever known.

>The stakes have changed in the 21st century. But the question remains the same as it ever was, the same as it was for those manning the crucibles of India, the blast furnaces of Germany, and the foundries of America. How do we get better at making steel?
