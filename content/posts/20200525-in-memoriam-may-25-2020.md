Today, across The United States we remember our loved ones that have gone on before us and the heroes that died for the cause of freedom. I am reminded of the immortal words of the great Abraham Lincoln.

>It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us&mdash;that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion&mdash;that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain&mdash;that this nation, under  God, shall have a new birth of freedom&mdash;and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
