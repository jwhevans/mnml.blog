I have only backed one Kickstarter project in the past and I've never been excited by a project until now. PICO is advertised as a simple, low maintenance, indoor growing solution. It has an innovative design that provides a wide spectrum light source and self-metered watering. The design is also nice. I backed a set of three and am looking forward to trying them out.

The project has already surpassed its funding and stretch targets. You can find more details on [Kickstarter][1].
