A few weeks ago I ran across this article at [InsideHook][1]. For years Amazon has crushed local and big chain book sellers. Now local book sellers have a lifeline.

>The lifeline in question is called [Bookshop][2]. In simple terms, it’s a super clean, user-friendly online bookstore whose raison d’être is supporting independent bookstores — not simply with exposure or resources (though that’s certainly a factor), but with cold hard cash. 

I updated the links on this site to point to Bookshop whenever possible. In the few cases where that wasn’t possible they point to [GoodReads][3]
