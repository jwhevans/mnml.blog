As someone who suffers from poor and declining vision, I found [the study referenced in this Futurism post][1] fascinating. It seems that a relatively short, approximately 3 minute per day, regimen of light therapy in the 650 to 1000 nm range could improve eye sensitivity in adults.

>For the study, 12 male and 12 female participants between the ages of 28 and 72 had the sensitivity of their eyes checked. They were then asked to stare into a small LED flashlight for three minutes a day over two weeks, a process  Jefferey likened to “re-charging a battery.”

>Participants’ ability to detect colors improved 20 percent among some of those 40 and older. Low light sensitivity improved significantly in the same group as well.

This is fairly easy to implement with a standard LED flashlight and red LEDs. I think it would be interesting to create a wearable set of glasses with embedded LEDs for the therapy. A timer could be included as well. I think I'll fab up a prototype.
