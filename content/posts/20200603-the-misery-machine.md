>There are no cogs at Facebook. There are complicit accomplices. The accomplices are not changing Facebook from the inside. If you work at Facebook, stop. If you sell coffee to Facebook employees, stop. If you buy ads on Facebook, stop. If you use Facebook to chat with your family and friends, stop. If you are on the board at Facebook, stop. All of these actions help feed Facebook’s community destroying engine.

Facebook is a criminal enterprise. I have never been on Facebook. I’m glad. However, I audited my accounts and I do have a WhatsApp account. Well, I did have a WhatsApp account. I don’t anymore.
