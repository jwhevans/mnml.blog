Last week SpaceX successfully launched another 60 satellites into orbit. These satellites are part of some 12,000 that are approved. They will create a global broadband network once a sufficient number have launched.

The next launch is tentatively scheduled for next month. The exact date and time is open. This launch manifest is different than previous launches. SpaceX will launch 60 Starlink satellites and an additionl 3 satellites from the satellite operator Planet. The three Planet satellites will increase Planet's SkySat system from 15 to 18 units.

SpaceX has sent up rideshares before but they were brokered through a third party. This is the first time SpaceX has worked directly with small satellite operators.

It is difficult to estimate the exact cost of a SpaceX launch. They are a private company so we must take their published data and make some estimations. It seems reasonable to assume that they are operating at a cheaper cost basis than their competitors. Ridesharing also lowers costs. If SpaceX can cut out the broker then smaller aerospace companies should be able to enter the space game.

It will be interesting to watch this market in the coming years. I think SpaceX is way ahead and we will see a significant increase in their launch manifests for these ridesharing projects.
