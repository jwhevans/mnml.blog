[Reuters][1] reports that shale drilling pioneer Chesapeake Energy has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

>Chesapeake Energy Corp (CHK.N) filed for Chapter 11 on Sunday, becoming the largest U.S. oil and gas producer to seek bankruptcy protection in recent years as it bowed to heavy debts and the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on energy markets.

Smaller companies have been dropping like flies. Chesapeake is a big player. I expect the dominoes are about to tumble.
