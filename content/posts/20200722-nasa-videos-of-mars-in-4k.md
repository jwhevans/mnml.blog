As a child I spent many summer weeks and weekends camping in the Rocky Mountains with my Dad. After I turned 10 years old we began backpacking. Most of our time was spent in the high wilderness areas inside of the Santa Fe National Forest and the Kit Carson National Forest. There is ample water most years and the areas are home to the highest peaks in New Mexico. I’ve always been a peak bagger so I preferred these areas. 

My Dad has a soft spot in his heart for the old west and the desert mountains. He loved to visit Socorro and Pie Town. Part of it was his nostalgia for his own father who lived in the area during the 1930’s. He liked to hike in the Gila National Forest near Silver City. It definitely had it’s charms. The land is rugged. Water is scarce even in the best years, but wildlife is everywhere. I have seen a giant moose crack small trees as it bounded away from me. We once spent several sleepless nights among the largest population of black bears I have ever seen.

I guess that experience resonates with me still because when I saw these images taken from Mars by the three NASA Martian Rovers I was completely mesmerized. These images make me want to explore. Some lucky person will one day set foot on Mars and what a sight they will behold.
