Last year the trump administration (lack of capitalization purposeful) banned H-1B visas. The reason given was the economic slowdown and unemployment in the United States. If you are not aware, the H-1B system supports immigrants with advanced degrees and is used extensively by technology companies, but also companies like my own that employ a large number of engineers.

On Wednesday, March 31 the Biden administration allowed the ban to expire. I know that many people believe the H-1B system hurts American workers. This is far from the truth. We hire as many Americans as possible and our workforce is American by a large margin. The supply of scientists and engineers graduating from American Universities in general and even more so that are American is less than the demand. Immigration is necessary for business in our country.

There is another narrative that H-1B recipients push down the wages of American workers. The market is far larger and far stronger than the H-1B's power to suppress wages. The vast majority of H-1B's go to the largest, highest paying companies. If anything H-1Bs are inflationary to smaller business as we must compete very hard for talent. 

It is already clear that Biden is not what I expected. He appears to be far more progressive than any President in modern times. I'm not sure what he will accomplish nor how I will judge the rest of his Presidency. I'm certain his administration made the correct decision here though.
