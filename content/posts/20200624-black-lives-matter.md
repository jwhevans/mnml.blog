## Black lives are important. Black lives are essential.

It’s been a few centuries since this horrific event started in the Americas. It’s been a few decades since peaceful protests became riots. It’s been a few years since the pointless killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson. It’s been a few weeks since the equally pointless and heinous killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. I know many have said that this time feels different. I hope that is the case but I know that humans are creatures of habit. We will avoid situations that make us uncomfortable. We will try to maintain the status quo.

I still see protests. I still hear discussions. There is some work happening in government and corporate America. I realize that the initial outrage must be replaced by a longer term resolve to do the hard work of changing the systems that are broken. I hope that none of us are willing to accept the status quo. We need to remind ourselves of the outrage and finish the work of teaching our children what the world should be. We need to finish the difficult task of changing the way our companies hire and promote people of color. We need to do the difficult work of changing our local government and school boards to ensure that they reflect our community’s diversity of race, and sex.

I once accompanied my maternal grandmother on a visit to a family that had lost a loved one. It was several weeks after the event. It was an interesting visit. I knew what it was like to lose a family member. It had happened several times in my life. In the area of the country that I’m from you are bombarded with visits, cards, flowers, casseroles, and promises to help in any way necessary. After a week or maybe two you are alone. You are sad and depressed. You need to throw away an unconscionable amount of flowers and food. You need to clean up and you just don’t feel up to the challenge. 

My grandmother knew all those things too. That’s why she went. She cleaned the kitchen and brought a fresh hot meal. Then she sat down and comforted a grieving family. I asked her why she chose to go on that day. She said that  grief doesn’t last a week or two. She said that now was the time they needed a friend.

The foundations of racism and bigotry run deep in our country. We won’t fix this in a week or two. I hope and pray that the coming elections and legislative cycles serve to wipe the slate, but then we must tear up the slate and pour a new and better foundation. Our foundation is not serving us anymore. We must not let our outrage fade. Let’s continue on. Let’s be a friend of justice always.
