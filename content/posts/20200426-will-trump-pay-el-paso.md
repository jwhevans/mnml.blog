Earlier this week the [Texas Tribune][1] reported that the Trump campaign owes the city of El Paso $500,000 for a rally held in the city last year.

>City officials sent the campaign the most recent invoice in February. The mayor on Tuesday said the city should consider filing a lawsuit to recoup the money as it faces down a budget shortfall from the new coronavirus.

The man has regularly used bankruptcy courts to get out of debts in business. We should not expect more from his campaign.

>Thirteen other cities are also waiting on repayment from the Trump campaign, the Center for Public Integrity reported last week. The total the campaign owes is more than $1.82 million, including about $543,000 to Minneapolis officials, and about $211,000 to the city of Albuquerque, the CPI reported.

No city should allow the Trump campaign to hold a rally this year.
