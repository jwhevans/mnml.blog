As they have done for several years, Tryolabs recently released their [“Top 20 Python Libraries of 2020”][1].

>The rules are simple. We are looking for libraries that satisfy the following conditions:
>
> 1. They were launched or popularized in 2020.
> 2. They are well maintained and have been since their launch data.
> 3. They are outright cool, and you should check them out.

I’m a big fan of #4, Pretty Errors. I make lots of mistakes and anything that helps me find the error more quickly is beneficial. #10, Scalene, is also a nice utility if you work with multi-threaded code. I just recently started working with multi-threaded programs and they are a mess to profile in Python.
