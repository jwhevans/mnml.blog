>Deutsche Bank is ending financing for new oil and gas projects in the oil sands and the Arctic region effective immediately, becoming the latest major bank to reconsider lending money to fossil fuel projects in sensitive areas.
>
>Deutsche Bank will no longer finance any new projects in the Arctic or the oil sands and will review all its existing business in the oil and gas industry, the bank said in a statement on Monday.  

Goldman Sachs dropped financing for these areas in January. U.S. shale plays can turn a profit at far lower prices than arctic plays and they are already entering bankruptcy protection in record numbers. Expect more turmoil in Alberta.

By the way, what does it say about your business when the bank that props up “Dear Leader Trump” won’t lend you money?
