According to [SpaceFlight Now][1] SpaceX has an opportunity to set a new record for the fastest turnaround flight to flight of an orbital rocket.

>In a tweet Saturday, the California-based launch company confirmed plans to launch the South Korean Anasis 2 military communications satellite Monday from pad 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The mission was previously scheduled to launch Tuesday, July 14, but SpaceX delayed the launch to address a problem on the Falcon 9’s second stage.

>The launch window Monday opens at 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT) and runs until 8:55 p.m. EDT (0055 GMT). The official launch weather forecast calls for isolated rain showers at Cape Canaveral on Monday evening, but there’s a 70 percent chance of acceptable conditions for liftoff of the Falcon 9 rocket during the nearly four-hour launch window.

As long as SpaceX launches the booster in July they will break their previous record of 62 days that was set in February of this year. SpaceX has steadily reduced the number of days needed to turnaround a rocket and has also increased the number of flights a rocket makes before being retired. Taken together these actions go a long way toward SpaceX’s mission of decreasing the cost of space launch 100x.
