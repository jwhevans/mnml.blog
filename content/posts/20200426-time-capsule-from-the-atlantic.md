From the [Reporter's Notebook of James Fallows][1]

>On the day when the Access Hollywood tape came out, one month before the 2016 election, I wrote a “Trump Time Capsule” item whose first paragraph, in its entirety, was:
>
>>“Good God.”

The Access Hollywood tape, for those that have forgotten, was crude and utterly appalling. It would have derailed any previous campaign. It did not derail his campaign. It seems that it actually helped his campaign. I won't repeat what Trump said. It should have ended his campaign but even a majority of "conservative" women continued to support him.

This week he said something even worse and far more dangerous.

>Here’s a question that some of you [the press] are probably thinking of, if you’re totally into that world [of science], which I find to be very interesting.
>
>Supposing we hit the body with a tremendous — whether it’s ultraviolet or just very powerful light … Supposing you brought the light inside the body [sic], either through the skin or some other way.
>
>And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute — one minute — and is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside, or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it would be interesting to check that.

Trump later claimed that he was being sarcastic. I grew up in a family that has a knack for understated sarcasm. I've watched the tape several times. There was no sarcasm. This was a man whose mind was wandering aimlessly and his mouth followed suit. What he said was ignorant and dangerous. He should not be allowed to speak in these events.

>And of the 53 Republicans who make up Mitch McConnell’s Senate majority? How many have spoken up to criticize the president—on the specifics of this new “plan,” or on what the comments reveal about his approach to reality in general—or to warn the public against his advice?
>
>As best I can determine, two days after Trump’s comments, that number is zero. This is the Vichy Republican bargain they made after the Access Hollywood tapes. It is the bargain that keeps an obviously unwell man in power now. It is the bargain for which they should be remembered.

I agree completely.
