The University of Houston Cougars, my alma mater, are playing in the NCAA Final Four tonight against their formal Southwest Conference rival, the Baylor Bears. It's our first Final Four appearance since the three year run of the great Phi Slama Jama teams from 1982-1984. Regardless of the outcome the city of Houston is electric. We love our Coogs.

Whose house? Coogs House!
