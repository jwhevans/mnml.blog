[This article][1] offers some nice tips for securing your postgresql database. In addition to the typical firewall and roles the article also gives information I was not familiar with in this context, e.g. Server TLS, row level security for rows, and auditing. 

If you are a novice postgres user/administrator I recommend this article. Keep it in your knowledge bucket.
