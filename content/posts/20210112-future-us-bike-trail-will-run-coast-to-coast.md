The United States is currently building a coast to coast bike trail from Washington D.C. to Washington state. [“The Great American Rail-Trail”][1] will stretch over 6000 km when completed. To date 3200 km are complete. The World Economic forum reports that the trail will connect more than 145 existing paths and serve more than 50 million people.
