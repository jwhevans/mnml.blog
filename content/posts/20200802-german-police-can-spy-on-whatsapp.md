A report on [Android Rookies][1] says that German authorities can spy on any user’s WhatsApp account without the need of malware. If this is true then we should assume that all state actors and many smaller scale entities also have the capability.

[I already decided to delete WhatsApp][2], but if you haven’t here is one more reason to consider it.
