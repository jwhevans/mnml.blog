Brendan Sleight is actively developing an [OpenSCAD library](https://github.com/bmsleight/lasercut) to aid in subtractive manufacturing methods such as lasercutting and CNC milling. It can support other 2D cutting methods as well, for example vinyl cutters. There is no way to output a DXF file from OpenSCAD's user interface so a bash script is used. The end result is a DXF that can be sent to many 2D subtractive manufacturing machines. Most OpenSCAD libraries are geared toward 3D printing. I really enjoy OpenSCAD. Extending it's applicability to 2D manufacturing methods is a welcome addition to my toolkit.
