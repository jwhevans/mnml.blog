I was introduced to the website [bronzeartifacts.com][1] through a github repo that I use on some 3D printing projects. From the artist,

>Robert Efroymson uses code and 3D printing to make objects that engage, and perhaps puzzle.
>
>I use code of my own crafting to design, analyze, and re-design forms.  Drawing on years of experience in other media, primarily photography, I search for balance and interest. Bronze sculpture is a team sport, and I work closely with great professionals on the casting, chasing, and patina work.
>
>Since my process is somewhat unusual, you might be interested in reading a bit more about the tools I use to create the work.

Check out his work. It's worth your time.
