The shale oil producer Pioneer is buying DoublePoint Energy for $6.4 billion, [according to OilPrice.com][1]. This is a debt, cash, and stock deal and the second for Pioneer in the past 6 months. Shale production is well below peak levels from early 2020 but is growing steadily.

The pandemic knocked out many producers of all sizes. Those that survived are now in a consolidation phase. I expect more consolidation and continued production growth the rest of the year. We may see returns to pre-pandemic peak production of 13 million bpd in 2022. With less players the plays should be more profitable.
