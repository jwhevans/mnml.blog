Hustwit is the directory of the documentaries *Helvetica* and *Objectified*. I this documentary he turned his lens on the iconic designer, Dieter Rams.

>[Rams includes in-depth conversations with Dieter, and deep dives into his philosophy, his process, and his inspirations. But one of the most interesting parts of Dieter's story is that he now looks back on his career with some regret. "If I had to do it over again, I would not want to be a designer," he's said. "There are too many unnecessary products in this world." Dieter has long been an advocate for the ideas of environmental consciousness and long-lasting products. He's dismayed by today's unsustainable world of over-consumption, where "design" has been reduced to a meaningless marketing buzzword.][1]

I don't know how I missed this when it was originally released. It is a nice look at Rams, his process, and the philosophy that gave rise to his iconic designs.
