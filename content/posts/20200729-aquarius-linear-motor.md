>At the beginning of June, Aquarius Engines, a startup in the Tel Aviv suburb of Rosh Ha’ayin, said it had signed a giant 250 million euro ($281 million), three-year contract with the Finnish tech giant Nokia. The contract will be worth 600 million euros over five years.

This isn’t seed funding. This is an actual contract for production equipment.

>Aquarius has designed an engine that can be used to bring power to remote locations across Asia. Field tests in the Philippines will start later this year, followed by mass production, according to a report by Bloomberg News.

The engine mentioned is a 4 piston, two stroke, linear internal combustion engine that is reported to have a thermodynamic efficiency of 34% under normal operating conditions. If that is true this is a remarkably efficient engine.

>Yaacoby’s idea for a linear internal combustion engine is conceptually speaking nothing new. The first patents for one were registered as early as 1940. There is even a Wikipedia entry on a free-piston linear generator. But the concept was tested and abandoned many times – it remained the elusive Holy Grail of the transportation industry.

Linear motors are subject to the same thermodynamic limits as the more standard rotary motors. Maximum theoretical efficiency depends on the difference between the highest and lowest temperature of the combustible material across the cycle. A linear system could be significantly less complex and would require far fewer moving parts so it could increase efficiency and reduce maintenance costs.

>Aquarius’ main competitor is the U.S. company Mainspring Energy, which was founded in 2010 by three Stanford graduates and is developing a linear generator that uses a low-temperature reaction of air and fuel to drive magnets through copper coils to produce electricity. It’s raised $133 million from investors that include Bill Gates and says it will have its first commercial engine on the market this year.

It remains to be seen whether Aquarius’s claims are real and it’s product can achieve significant traction on the market. If not there are many others chasing the same technologies. For now Aquarius is staying away from the automotive industry.

>One big market is in the telecommunications industry, says Gorfung. Today, around the world there are 4.5 million antennas using for mobile communications, but next-generation 5G technology will increase that to 20 million. About 15% of them need to be powered by generators that sell for between $5,000 and $12,000 each – a $15 billion market. The entire global market for generators is worth $100 billion.

Nokia seems to think that Aquarius is on to something and they are putting their money on the technology with a significant contract to provide generators throughout South and Southeast Asia. I’m really interested to see how this plays out. The dimensions and power density quoted in the article are phenomenal. This could significantly reduce the need for fossil fuels while also extending their useful lifetime.
