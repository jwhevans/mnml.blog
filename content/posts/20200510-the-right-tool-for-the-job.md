I'm an Apple fan and like many Apple fans I enjoy reading the various Apple blogs and listening to the many Apple related podcasts. I'm also a former manufacturing engineer turned operations officer that is intrigued by the entire Apple Product Process and their production and supply chain prowess. Several years ago we wanted to purchase a particular piece of equipment but were unable to because Apple had acquired this manufacturer's capacity for the next year. They bought an entire year's worth of machines gearing up for an iPhone launch!

Apple the production behemoth is very interesting to me, but today I want to look at one of their products, the iPad, and the current obsession with it as a device for doing "real" work. I was prompted to write this after reading the excellent article by Matt Birchler, "Buying Into A Philosophy". In that article he wrote,

>[This all makes me wonder if the fact that Apple makes both macOS and iPadOS makes people feel like they need to like both of them equally.][1]

I believe he was making reference to those people who are truly eager to make the iPad their primary computing device but find it doesn't fit their workflow, rather than the other cohort who actually don't like the iPad and write click-bait about why it isn't a true computer.

I really appreciate Matt's take on the situation. Apple customers are opinionated. We love our computers and our computing environment. We all came from different places and directions, but we all converged at the same point. We love our Macs and iDevices.

We don't have to love them equally and Apple doesn't care if we do. I have not seen it mentioned recently, but their product strategy is to provide personal computing devices of all screen sizes and to constantly push device capabilities forward. They want the next generation iPhone to push the iPad to push the Mac and so on. The strategy isn't exactly linear and it isn't always executed in the way we hope, but across 2-3 generations of product I think they are nailing it.

Apple is providing devices that fit a wide range of needs and a vast majority of consumers can find a device that suits their purpose. So why all the complaining when you or I feel more productive on a Mac as compared to an iPad. Why does it matter? Is Apple leaving us out? Are all Apple products meant for us? 

I generally work on three devices and four operating systems each day. I have a Dell workstation in my office that runs Windows 7. I use a 2015 15" rMBP as my daily computer. It goes with me everywhere. I have a 2018 11" iPad Pro with the new Magic Keyboard. I access some Linux servers through all of them. All three are very capable machines. 

Windows is not my preferred operating system but it is solid, it connects to our ERP and internal systems and Microsoft is rapidly rolling out tools that make it very easy to integrate our machinery and processes. 

I love my Mac. I love macOS. I love macOS even more than the Mac itself. I'm never more comfortable than I am on my Mac. One reason why I love the Mac is because I have built up a set of tools over many years that make the Mac "home". I often hear complaints about the iPad being fiddly or always needing shortcuts to do real work. That isn't different than how I use my Mac. The only difference is that I have already created the scripts and shortcuts and they are so ingrained in my muscle memory that work just flows.

That being said, there are times and tasks each day where I prefer the iPad. I take my iPad to meetings. There are great apps on the iPad for taking notes, and capturing tasks. The Apple Pencil is an amazing tool. Being able to sketch, markup and collaborate on drawings and presentations is so much fun and so much more productive than on any other computing platform. Email is better on the iPad. Unfortunately, for most of us email constitues "real work". Finally, what many people don't see are the internal apps that many companies use to manage inventory, document assemblies, capture testing data, and even control large industrial machinery. The iPad is a dream. It is a portable workhorse, and with the right software it finds applications in areas that we would never place a Mac or a PC.

The thing is, every tool has a place. I have seen many people use a screwdriver as a chisel or a prybar. It isn't quite the same as forcing a square peg into a round hole, but it isn't ideal either. We need to choose the right tools for the job. Don't worry if the iPad doesn't fit your needs. Don't force it into your workflow. Choose the tool that serves your purpose.
