I first saw Linkin Park live in 2003 during Metallica's "Summer Sanitarium Tour." I was in the front row for Mudvayne, Deftones, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, and Metallica. I should have worn earplugs. Kirk Hammett blew me away. I was deaf for three days after. It was an amazing day. Fred Durst had been booed off the stage the previous week in Chicago and I wanted to dislike him but he was unbelievably charismatic.

It was Linkin Park that stole the show though. I loved every minute of their performance. Every song was perfect, and of course, Chester was himself, a total rockstar. I still love Linkin Park. They are one of the bands I turn to when I'm broken and when I'm on cloud 9. I am forever grateful for music, for its ability to bring disparate people together, and for its ability to heal the soul.

I suffer from depression. Music is one of several ways that I treat my depression. It is one of the great and unfortunate ironies of life that many of the authors, musicians, and artists which help so many of us also suffer and often succumb to this terrible disease.

Depression is hard, but if you suffer from it, remember that you are not alone. It is a disease like a cold, or the flu, nothing more. Don't let others stigmatize or belittle your condition. You matter to me and I know you matter to others in your life.
