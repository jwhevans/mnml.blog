iOS 14 will introduce a new feature that notifies users when an app accesses your clipboard. Many developers have confirmed a [previously reported][1] misuse of the clipboard by the popular app TikTok.  Among them is this tweet by Twitter user Jeremy Burge.

{{< tweet 1275896482433040386 >}}

TikTok told [The Telegraph][2] that they have already submitted an update for iOS users that addresses the issue.

>Following the beta release of ‌iOS 14‌ on June 22, users saw notifications while using a number of popular apps.
>
>For TikTok, this was triggered by a feature designed to identify repetitive, spammy behavior. We have already submitted an updated version of the app to the App Store removing the anti-spam feature to eliminate any potential confusion.
>
>TikTok is committed to protecting users' privacy and being transparent about how our app works.

I see no way that this “feature” could be used to identify spammy behavior. It is a feature to spy on user data. Also, TikTok has only announced a change to iOS users. There is no word whether Android users will get an update.

[BoredPanda][3] has a good writeup of a developer, *bangorlol*, that has claimed to reverse engineer the TikTok app. If true, TikTok is less social network and more Chinese spyware. Bangorlol’s original writeup is available on [Reddit][4].

Make your own decisions with regard to apps and security but I highly recommend that you keep your kids off this platform.
