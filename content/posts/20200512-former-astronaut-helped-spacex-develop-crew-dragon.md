Yesterday [The Verge][1] published an interview with former NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman. The entire article is a great read for space junkies. Reisman recalls his first interaction with SpaceX in 2010. He was able to visit their site due to a rain delay for his mission.

>The whole crew went. We walked around that launch pad, and it suddenly hit me that this was a real, serious endeavor — that it wasn’t just a bunch of hobbyists. In a very short period of time, they had taken this old launch pad and completely converted it for a brand new rocket and were getting ready to launch in very short order. They were doing stuff in months that would have taken NASA, at the time, years.

The company I work for has also done some work with SpaceX and NASA. It's true that they are totally different companies. NASA is truly risk averse. I would not say that SpaceX encourages risk. They have very good engineers and processes. They don't get bogged down in bureaucratic minutiae.

>We had to overcome some cultural differences. We were this Silicon Valley-type company with that kind of an ethos, and NASA was a government bureaucracy. They had different ways of looking at the world, and we needed these two organizations to really work together. It was a challenge in the beginning. I want to emphasize that we got there, and now NASA and SpaceX, as we get ready to launch Bob and Doug, it’s amazing to me to see how closely they’re working together and how well they communicate and get along. It’s come a long, long way, and it’s immensely gratifying to me to see that.

I can't speak personally here, but I think SpaceX is extremely lucky to have Gwynne Shotwell as COO. She manages to keep Elon at bay while moving the company forward. Tesla needs a Gwynne as well.
