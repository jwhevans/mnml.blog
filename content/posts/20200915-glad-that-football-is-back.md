I'm watching the Steelers and Giants. I just thought how nice it is that the NFL is playing. I hope the players are getting the testing necessary to ensure they minimize their COVID risks, although I'm not sure COVID is the biggest worry for long term players. Not having fans doesn't change the game much for television. In fact I like that there are less camera breaks from the field.

I'm a Packers fan so this has been a good opening weekend. I feel for everyone that has to play against Aaron Rodgers this year. One of the few advantages teams have against him is crowd noise. With teams pumping in a steady 70 dB he's going to be deadly with the hard count.
