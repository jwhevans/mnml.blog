📺  I watched the first 5 episodes of “Ted Lasso” on Apple TV+. I wasn’t sure if I would like it after the first episode. Ted’s (Jason Sudeikis) accent and overly optimistic attitude were too much. The second episode was better and by episode 3 the show found its heart. It is a great television show. ★★★★☆
