Two days ago, on May 13, SpaceX test fired a Falcon 9 that is scheduled to launch Sunday May 17, weather permitting. This flight will launch another 60 Starlink satellites into orbit. If the launch is successful SpaceX will have 480 Starlink satellites orbiting the planet. SpaceX has approval for up to 12,000 satellites in the Starlink constellation. The current plan is to launch 1000 by 2021.

This is the last launch planned by SpaceX before they attempt the first crewed mission to launch from U.S. soil since 2011. That launch is scheduled for May 27.
