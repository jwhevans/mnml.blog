![Aaron Rodgers Artwork](/img/aaron-rodgers-line-art.jpeg)

I posted a new make at [PrusaPrinters](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/105703-aaron-rodgers-line-art). As a die-hard Green Bay Packers fan I wanted some homemade memorabilia of our current 3x MVP and future hall of fame quarterback. I drew the artwork on an iPad and then created an SVG file in Inkscape that was extruded using OpenSCAD for the final print.
