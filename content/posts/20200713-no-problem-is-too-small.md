I’ve long been a fan of Richard Feynman. Over the years I’ve read everything I could find about him. I have a copy of the “red books,” his lectures on physics. There is much written good and bad about Feynman. His detractors paint him as boastful and self-aggrandizing. I never knew him so I can only look at his accomplishments. I see a playful, curious man that never lost that beautiful gift of childhood, wonder.

The excerpt below is from a letter he wrote to Koichi Mano. The full text of the letter can be found [here][1].

>No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it.
>
>You say you are a nameless man. You are not to your wife and to your child. You will not long remain so to your immediate colleagues if you can answer their simple questions when they come into your office. You are not nameless to me. Do not remain nameless to yourself – it is too sad a way to be. Know your place in the world and evaluate yourself fairly, not in terms of your naïve ideals of your own youth, nor in terms of what you erroneously imagine your teacher’s ideals are.

This is quintessential Feynman. It perfectly captures his work throughout a storied career. Feynman was a tinkerer at heart. He studied engineering before he pursued a Ph.D in physics. Even after he helped to develop quantum electrodynamics, the most accurate theory in human history, he continued to pursue research in “humble” areas. He rarely followed the beaten path. Few if any physicists of his caliber would dabble in solid state research. They would not tussle with the practical engineering problems like fluid turbulence. Nor would they study liquid helium. Feynman was fascinated by all of them and he made significant advances in all these areas.

In my life I often hear Koichi Mano in my mind. I worry that my skill set is less than that of others around me. I worry that I’m wasting time on projects that are too small, that are too humble, that won’t garner recognition. I keep trying to channel Feynman. I am not nameless. I am not unimportant. No problem is too small, too humble. I should work on all problems because their solution may help someone else. The world is a big jigsaw puzzle and all the pieces are interesting. If we see a piece that we can place then we should place it.
