[CNBC][1] posted this graphic to show monthly job losses and job gains since 2015. The person responsible for the chart either did not understand the data or worse; they wanted to present a false narrative.  The writer of the article is certainly providing misinformation. The headline, “The recovery from the coronavirus sure looks V-shaped, going by these charts” is false. The data is not v-shaped. A -20.7 million data point is followed by a 2.5 million data point.  The total job *gains* in May were 12% of the total job *losses* in April. This graphic should be removed.  A bar chart or a waterfall would present a factual view of the data.
