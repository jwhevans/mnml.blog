The [New York Times][1] and others are reporting that the Trump administration expects COVID cases and deaths to double or more in May. Despite this they are pressing forward to reopen the economy.

>As President Trump presses for states to reopen their economies, his administration is privately projecting a steady rise in the number of coronavirus cases and deaths over the next several weeks. The daily death toll will reach about 3,000 on June 1, according to an internal document obtained by The New York Times, nearly double the current number of about 1,750.

This administration could claim ignorance for the initial outbreak. I don’t believe it was ignorance, but they could claim it. What they are doing now is beyond stupid. It is criminal.
