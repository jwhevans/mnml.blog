[This is a nice introduction to what data science is and what it is not.][1]

>ABCs of data science is intended for anyone who wants to learn more about data science, regardless of skill level. It aims to give readers a high level overview of various data science concepts, so that they can explore these topics further.

I have enjoyed the items that are currently published and look forward to reading the rest. I am working on a post about algorithms and found the information about AI and bias helpful in my research.
