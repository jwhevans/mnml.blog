Reported by [Futurism][1] and [Phys.org][2]

Scientists at the University of Otago report that they have "held" individual atoms in place and observed reactions such as atomic collisions.

>The team even managed to observe two of three atoms collide to form a molecule — a process that has never been observed on this scale before. They were surprised at how long it took compared to previous experiments and calculations.
>
>“By working at this molecular level, we now know more about how atoms collide and react with one another,” lead author and postdoc researcher Marvin Weyland said in a statement. “With development, this technique could provide a way to build and control single molecules of particular chemicals.”
