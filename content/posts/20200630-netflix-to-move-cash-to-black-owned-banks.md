[The New York Times][1] reports that Netflix plans to move up to 2% of its cash into Black owned banks. These banks are more likely to invest in predominantly Black communities.

>The idea was hatched in April during discussions about improving diversity within Netflix’s leadership ranks, company executives and others involved told DealBook’s Michael J. de la Merced. The idea of helping black-owned and -run banks emerged, and Aaron Mitchell, a member of Netflix’s recruiting team, took the lead in developing it.

It think 2% is low, but it is a start. These actions speak louder than words.
