I have an Apple developer account and dabble but I’m not a developer. This day isn’t for me but I really enjoy it. I’ve been an Apple customer for years and I always enjoyed the big shows.

Some clever developers will find bits of code and the rumor mill will spin. Today is Christmas in Apple-land.
