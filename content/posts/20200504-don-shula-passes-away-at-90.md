Don Shula, the NFL’s all-time leader for wins as a coach and the only person to coach a team to a perfect season passed away today. I was young when he was finishing his career and I wasn’t a Dolphins fan so I don’t remember his teams. Though, as a fan of the game I don’t believe it is possible to understate his accomplishments as a coach.

He won 328 regular season games. This was done in the 14 game per season era. His teams had to win year in and year out. It is extremely difficult to win in the NFL. Many a long-suffering Browns fan can attest to the fact. It is even harder to win consistently. His lifetime win percentage was .665. It’s a remarkable achievement.

More importantly, he did all this while maintaining the utmost integrity. As far as I can tell, it is universally accepted that he was unwilling to take shortcuts. He did not want unfair advantages. He wanted to play the game on the field, straight up. There are many stories regarding his integrity and I find it refreshing to think about especially right now.
