Radcliffe Medical Devices has designed a new mask with a truly novel design. The [Leaf][1] is a clear mask. It protects while allowing others to see your face. The manufacturer claims that it meets an N99 standard by protecting the wearer from 99.97% of particles larger than 0.3 micron. They also claim that it is self-sanitizing with an optional UVC light.
