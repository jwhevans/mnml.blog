Internet suicide is the act of purposefully removing your presence from the world wide web. It can be remarkably tricky. I’ve done it a few times over the years. It’s surprising how much of a data trail we create. Search engines index our screen handles and posts. We sign up for accounts without thinking and then promptly forget about them. Even though we don’t remember the internet does. I highly recommend the use of a password manager to help with this. They make it much easier to audit your accounts and close the ones you don’t need.

If you feel the need to reduce your online footprint, [this handy dandy infographic from WD Storage can help][1].
