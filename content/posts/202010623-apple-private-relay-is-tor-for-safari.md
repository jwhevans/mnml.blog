Apple’s upcoming operating systems include a new feature in Safari, Private Relay. The functionality is essentially the same as onion routing which you may know from the [Tor Project][2]. Bruce Schneier has a [nice overview][1] on his site. Of note:

>Not available in China, of course — and also Belarus, Colombia, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkmenistan, Uganda, and the Philippines.

I’m glad Apple is building this into Safari. It is a useful feature that will help anonymize your internet traffic. Remember that if you login to a website your anonymity goes away immediately. As a global enterprise Apple has to make compromises in certain parts of the world. If anonymity is important for your life or well-being or if you are simply privacy conscious and travel to the places listed above I still recommend using Tor.
