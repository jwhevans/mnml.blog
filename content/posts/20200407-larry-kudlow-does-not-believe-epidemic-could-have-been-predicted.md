> "I don't believe anybody could have predicted the exponential rise of this, but whatever ..." - Larry Kudlow, National Economic Counsel Directory

He obviously doesn't understand mathematics or doesn't trust the established mathematical models. I wonder if his ignorance of these concepts apply to economic models as well. ðŸ¤”
