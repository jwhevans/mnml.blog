Demi Adejuyigbe has been making videos to the famous Earth, Wind & Fire song September since 2015. This yearâ€™s is *the last* and is spectacular. He asks for a donation to one of three charities. They are all good choices. Donations are accepted [here](https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/september-21stthats-today-by-demi-adejuyigbe). I would suggest The West Fund to help women facing assaults on their reporductive rights in Texas.
