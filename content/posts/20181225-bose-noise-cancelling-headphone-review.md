Earlier this year I purchased a set of [Bose QC 35ii headphones][1]. I travel a fair amount for work and thought they would be a nice addition to my go-bag. 35,000 miles later and overall I’m quite satisfied. [Amazon][2] regularly runs deals where you can save $50 to $100 USD so don’t pay the retail price of $349.95.

**Pros**

* Premium look and feel
* Bose sound quality
* Long battery life
* Excellent bluetooth features
* Connect app
  
**Cons**

* Ear cuffs are smaller than some competitors (Sony XM1000)
* Highest level of noise cancellation can cause discomfort in certain environments
* Smart assistant button doesn’t interface with Siri
  
**Review**

To begin I should note that I’m not an audiophile. I love music and have a large, eclectic set of albums on CD and in iTunes but I can’t hear the difference between a professionally mastered CD and a 128 kbps rip of that same CD. My main headphones are a pair of Apple AirPods. Both left and right have been replaced because I wore out the batteries. That being said there is a definite difference in the quality of output on the QC 35s. It is a great listening experience.

Battery life is specified as 40 hours for wired use and 20 hours for wireless use. My primary use case is wireless and 20 hours is accurate. On two trips to Europe, 9 hours direct, I was able to use the headphones continuously over and back without recharging.

Noise cancellation is one of those technologies that cannot be fully appreciated until it is tried and after you experience it you cannot understand how you lived without it. The QC 35s will not eliminate all ambient sounds, nor will any other noise cancelling headphones. What they will do is almost completely remove repetitive mechanical noise from your environment. On a plane or train it is nothing short of magical. The environment fades away and your movie or music takes center stage.

Bose recommends their Connect app to setup and manage the QC 35s. I’m not a fan of many 3d party apps but I tried it and it is a nice app. It is quick to pair, performs the setup, and then gets out of your way. I’ve never used it again. The QC 35s just work. Bose has some features that are not available in most bluetooth headphones. The one that I find the most useful is the ability to simultaneously connect to multiple sources. After turning on the headphones I almost always hear, “Connected to James’ iPhone, Connected to James’ MacBook Pro.’ I can start playback on either device and the QC 35s switch automatically. If a phone call comes in I can answer from my Mac, iPhone, or the headphones. I really don’t know why AirPods don’t have this functionality.

Music controls and functionality for podcasts is achieved through the dedicated hardware buttons on the right headphone. The left earphone has a button that can be used as a dedicated control for Google or Amazon assistants, but alas not Siri. It’s all very intuitive and works flawlessly.

Some reviewers complain about discomfort within the ear while using noise cancellation. I have also experienced this particularly with the highest level of noise cancellation while wearing the headphones in a quieter environment such as coffee shops. Apparently this was a bigger problem on previous generation headphones and Bose has addressed it by allowing you to select three levels of noise cancellation (high, low, off). I have found that high is comfortable on flights, low is comfortable in a coffee shop type of environment, and off is perfect at home. The level of noise cancellation is easily changed as needed with the hardware button on the left earphone.

My biggest complaint is that the headphones become physically uncomfortable for me after about 4 hours of continuous use. That is such an uncommon occurrence that it really isn’t worth mentioning but I needed something to complain about.

**Conclusion**

If you are an audiophile these are probably not the headphones for you, but then you already know that. If you travel extensively then you need a pair of noise cancelling headphones. They will quickly become an indispensable item in your go-bag. I’ll never travel without mine again. I don’t buy many things and I truly enjoy even less of the things that I do buy. I enjoy my Bose headphones. They are easily one the top 5 things I own.
