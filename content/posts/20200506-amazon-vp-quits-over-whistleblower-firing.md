Amazon has been under scrutiny lately after some workers were fired. Amazon claims the workers were ["spreading misinformation and making false claims about Amazon.”][1] After that incident several people spoke out and were fired as well. The exact cause is a matter of dispute, but it seems that one VP didn't agree with the company line and has quit.

>[In a scathing letter, Amazon vice president and senior engineer Tim Bray announced he’s leaving the company for “firing whistleblowers who were making noise about warehouse employees frightened of COVID-19.”][2]

I think this story has legs. This is just the beginning and I expect we will hear from company executives and Jeff Bezos in the coming weeks. I have a lot of respect for Mr. Bray. It isn't easy to speak out. He probably expected to be fired for his actions. Still, it's a bold step to quit.
