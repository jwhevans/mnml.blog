Another nice OpenSCAD library to help with subtractive manufacturing tasks is [AlClosure](https://github.com/0xPIT/AlClosure). It was featured on [Hackaday.com](https://hackaday.com/2021/12/26/planning-custom-aluminum-enclosures-with-openscad/). The library is billed as a way to design "A Beautiful Professional Aluminum Enclosure", but the techniques can be applied to other materials and components as well. To build the designs you will need some tools, e.g. press brake, mill, drill with various bits.
