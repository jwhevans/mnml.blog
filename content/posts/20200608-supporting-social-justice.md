Recent events have opened many eyes to the ongoing racial injustice in America. I have spent the past two weeks trying to dissect my thoughts. I have spent time reading books that were recommended by black friends and bloggers. I have changed the people that I follow online. I’m working to ensure that I follow minorities and women. I’ve adjusted my giving. There are so many organizations that we can support. I am not qualified to make suggestions. I will simply state that I’m currently supporting [ACLU][1], [Campaign Zero][2], and [Amy McGrath][3] for Senate in Kentucky.

I have also had difficult discussions with my children. They should not have to live in a world where their friends are afraid to be outside in the evening. They should live in a world where the President of the United States of America is an imperfect but respectable human being. Currently, they do not live in that world. I have realized something recently though. A big part of the problem is that we teach our children the great American myths, but we too often shy away from the hard truth. By teaching my children that black Americans have been persecuted, denigrated, and murdered without remorse in our society for 400 years I learned that they can handle the truth. 

When I was eleven years old I fully believed that in America everyone had an equal chance to succeed. I am not teaching my eleven year old the same lies. I’m teaching him that this country was founded by white male landowners, many of whom held slaves, and that they created a government to protect their interests. I’m teaching him that our origins have far reaching consequences. I’m teaching him that his black friends are equal to him as humans but they don’t have the same opportunities that he has. The world is unfair and our systems hinder their opportunities. I’m teaching him that we have to be honest and accept that those roadblocks exist and that we must be careful not to perpetuate them. Finally, I’m teaching him to have courage and speak up for his friends when he sees them experience racial injustice.

After two weeks I also realize that children understand these things intuitively. They have to learn racism. My son is teaching me more than I’m teaching him.
