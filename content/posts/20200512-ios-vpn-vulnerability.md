As a follow-up to today's earlier post the [Mullvad Blog][1] mentions a known bug in iOS 13.3.1 and possibly later versions that could compromise your traffic encryption. The fix to mitigate the risk is quite simple. After connecting to the VPN: 

- Enable Airplane Mode.
- Turn off Wi-Fi if itâ€™s on.
- Disable Airplane Mode.

I have created a shortcut in iOS that makes this simple.
