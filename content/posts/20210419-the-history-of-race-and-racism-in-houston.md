Continuing with yesterday's post I think it is worth highlighting this list of [20 books][1] from the Houston Chronicle that highlight the history of racism in Houston. 

Houston prides itself on its diversity. It is truly a melting pot with immigrants flocking to the city from all areas of the world, but Houston has a poor record when it comes to racism even today. I love my city but we must acknowledge that while we did not go the way of cities like Birmingham this is still a highly segregated and inequitable city. 

Learn the past and work for a better future.
