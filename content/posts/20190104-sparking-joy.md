I had a long conversation on the phone with my sister today. As is often the case the talk turned to minimalism, happiness, and for some reason we digressed to Marie Kondo. I've been a fan of Kondo's since her first book was published in English so I guess this is not a strange digression.

I've been lucky enough to be on vacation since before Christmas so I spent the rest of the day contemplating the things that bring me joy. It's an important exercise because I have a tendency to focus entirely on the future and forget how blessed I am right now. I've spent the better part of the last two years trying to be more aware and attentive to the here and now.

I thought about many things but only a few truly create joy in my life and very few are material possessions. I think that is a good thing, but then I tend toward minimalism. I don't make New Year's resolutions. I find the New Year to be a strange and quite arbitrary marker for time. I prefer to make lists and goals and check in on them from time to time in a more continuous process. So I decided I would make a list of the things I came up with today as a reminder to my future self.

**The Things That Bring Me Joy**

* Playing board games with the kids
* Visiting the library and reading with the kids
* Studying, learning, and developing new skillsets
* Exercising (weight training in particular, running is necessary for me but sucks)
* Discussing engineering problems with my team
* Hiking
* Good coffee
* Cooking and good food
* Thoughtful, carefully articulated arguments
* Dominoes (not the pizza)
* Kindle Paperwhite
* Eames Lounge Chair
