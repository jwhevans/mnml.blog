Lawrence Tesler died Sunday February 16. He is someone that I had heard of, but I had no idea of his impact on the current computing world.

>[Mr. Tesler was passionate about simplifying interaction with computers. At Apple he was responsible for the idea that a computer mouse should have only one button. For many years the license plate on his car read, “NO MODES.”][1]

Cut, Copy, and Paste are ubiquitous now. Any computing system that does not support them is hobbled. Mr. Tesler invented these interactions and eliminated the then prevalent "modes" of text entry and text editing. I love the quote above. I also hate modality in systems.
