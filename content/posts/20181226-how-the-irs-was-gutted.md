The IRS is slowing being gutted. Via [ProPublica][1]

>Corporations and the wealthy are the biggest beneficiaries of the IRS’ decay. Most Americans’ interaction with the IRS is largely automated. But it takes specialized, well-trained personnel to audit a business or a billionaire or to unravel a tax scheme — and those employees are leaving in droves and taking their expertise with them.

Corporations have fought and largely won to be considered as a type of ‘citizen.’ They are afforded the vast majority of rights that we have as individuals. As such, I believe they also bear a responsibility to the country that grants them those rights in accordance with their size. However, they also have resources that are not available to individuals. It’s an unfair playing field. I’m a part of corporate America too. We can and do pay highly specialized people significant sums of money to reduce our tax bills. That isn’t necessarily a problem, but creative people sometimes take the creativity beyond what is lawful.

>The story has been different for poor taxpayers. The IRS oversees one of the government’s largest anti-poverty programs, the earned income tax credit, which provides cash to the working poor. Under continued pressure from Republicans, the IRS has long made a priority of auditing people who receive that money, and as the IRS has shrunk, those audits have consumed even more resources, accounting for 36 percent of audits last year. The credit’s recipients — whose annual income is typically less than $20,000 — are now examined at rates similar to those who make $500,000 to $1 million a year. Only people with incomes above $1 million are examined much more frequently.

We have a long history of fighting taxes. “No taxation without representation,” is a founding cry for the republic. It seems that the tables have turned. Now, “no taxation if you’ve got representation,” would be a better fit.“

>Abolish the IRS” remains a potent talking point. Ted Cruz, the Republican senator from Texas, campaigned on the slogan when he ran for president in 2016.

I really hoped we were going to get rid of this idiot in 2018, but alas Texas is still not quite ready to give up its status as a Republican anchor state.

One problem with “no taxes,” is simple. No resources means no infrastructure, no schools, etc. No taxes is a simplification of course. What these anti-IRS supporters want is a tax system that favors them more than the current system, and one that has less oversight. The other problem is that it is extremely short-sighted. We’ve already had a world where the top 1% controlled everything. An economy doesn’t grow on the work of the top 1%. It grows because it has a strong, educated working class.

Update from [The New York Times][2]: With enforcement enfeebled, as much as 20 percent of potential tax revenues go uncollected.
