I'm not sure how I missed [this report from last June][1]. 

>USA Rare Earth, the funding and development partner of the Round Top heavy rare earth project and Texas Mineral Resources announced Thursday that its rare earths pilot plant processing facility in Wheat Ridge, Colorado has received the required permits and officially opened.
>
>Once fully commissioned, the plant will be focused on group separation of rare earths into heavy (dysprosium, terbium), middle, and light (neodymium, praseodymium) rare earths (REEâ€™s) and will be the first facility to separate the full range of rare earth elements in the US since 1999.

Rare earth elements and associated non-rare earth elements that are often mined from the same sites are critical to every technology we rely on. We are currently in the middle of a chip shortage that affects the ability of everyone from manufacturers of automobiles to space toaster ovens. The supply chain for chips is vast and having a secure supply of rare earth elements is critical. Only time will tell if the Biden and future administrations continue to invest in chip and battery manufacturing technology in the United States but investments such as this are crucial regardless of where final production takes place.
