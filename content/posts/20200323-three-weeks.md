[John Marshall on March 20:][1]

>February 26th, 2020. President Trump: “When you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that’s a pretty good job we’ve done.”
>
>March 20th, 2020. Confirmed cases in the United States rise to 16,064.

[As of March 22 there were approximately 32,000 confirmed cases and less than 0.1% of the population has been tested.][2] The current doubling period is roughly 2.4 days. More than a quarter million people could test positive by this time next week. This is a serious issue.

I was never a Trump supporter. I disagree with the current administration's politics completely. I do not believe that it is a political statement to criticize their handing of this epidemic. There should be no politics in disease response. We must be guided by science and rationality. This President is opposed to science and is irrational at best. He is unfit for the current task.
