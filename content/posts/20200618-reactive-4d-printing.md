In 2018 researcher’s at Rice University’s [Verduzco Laboratory][1] published work on [4D materials][1]. This type of material changes shape when exposed to a stimulus. In particular the researchers developed materials that changed shape significantly when exposed to changes in temperature.

All known physical materials change shape if subjected to a large enough change in temperature. For example, ice will melt, and even metals can grow or shrink while maintaining their solid state. The work at Rice is different because complex shapes were created, including a face, a logo, even a rose. These shapes were made in a mold.

The research was interesting but recent advances are pushing the technology closer to mainstream applications. Researchers have now developed a way to [4D print the materials][3]. This allows for development of complex, novel shapes that can be printed on standard 3D systems.

>”Overcoming that limitation to decouple the printing process from shaping is a significant step toward more useful materials,” said Verduzco, who is also an associate professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and of Materials Science and Nanoengineering. “These materials, once fabricated, will change shape autonomously. We needed a method to control and define this shape change. Our simple idea was to use multiple reactions in sequence to print the material and then dictate how it would change shape. Rather than trying to do this all in one step, our approach gives more flexibility in controlling the initial and final shapes and also allows us to print complex structures.”

This is a fascinating technology. Much more information is given in the article. You can also find the full published study [here][4].
