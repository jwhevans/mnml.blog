Every other Thursday I have a special evening with one of my kids. Tonight was with my youngest son. As always we had a great time. We grabbed an ice cream. We sat at the park and ate it, then we played at the playground. We went home and swam for an hour. He took off his swim vest tonight, jumped in and swam out for the first time! I was so proud. Then we ate a sandwich and he went home to his mom.

I was reflecting afterwards. He always has fun because he always says yes. He doesn’t care what we do. I love these nights also because I don’t care what the kids want to do. I just want to be with them. We need to say yes more and live. Life is too short for no.<!--more-->
