[Jeannie Kever reporting for the University of Houston][1]

>Researchers from the University of Houston, in collaboration with others, have designed a “catch and kill” air filter that can trap the virus responsible for COVID-19, killing it instantly.

The test results are promising with a 99.8% first pass kill rate for the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. This could be a useful technology for higher density public spaces such as offices, shopping centers, airports, etc. It would be interesting to see the efficacy of this filter as well as other filter types on various viruses.
