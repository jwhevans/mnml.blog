Last night as I was scrolling Twitter I learned that Norm MacDonald had died after a private 9 year battle with cancer. I’ve always enjoyed Norm’s comedy. I loved his deadpan delivery and the way that he seemed to care more about the craft of telling a good joke than the result. A lot has been written about Norm chasing the perfect joke. I think it was clearly evident every time he was on stage that he was a craftsman and completely dedicated to the craft. I’m thankful that we live in the time of YouTube and other media so that we can remember him and the great laughs that he brought for so many years.

In his book *Based on a True Story: A Memoir*, Norm wrote, 

>It can be difficult to define yourself by something that happened so long ago and is gone forever. It’s like a fellow at the end of the bar telling no one in particular about the silver medal he won in high school track, the one he still wears around his neck. The only thing an old man can tell a young man is that it goes fast, real fast, and if you’re not careful it’s too late. Of course, the young man will never understand this truth. . . . But it is impossible for me to be bitter. I’ve been lucky.

We should all feel so blessed.
