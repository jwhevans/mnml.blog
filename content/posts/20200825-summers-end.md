I’ve never lived in a year quite like this one. Personally, it began with promise but quickly devolved. I have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic far less than so many and I am thankful for that. I began the year with plans and hope. I was close to finalizing a long running divorce. It had been ugly at times and worst of all, it was difficult for my children. It was nearly over though and we were all settling into a new routine. The pandemic caused delays and cost me some time and treasure but I was able to hold it together. That is until recently. My ex-wife has a new boyfriend. I had expected that it would happen and thought that I had prepared myself emotionally for it to happen. He truly seems to be a nice guy. Under different circumstances I could see us being friends. My kids like him. I didn’t prepare myself for that. Fuck me, that is hard to swallow. It eats at me like a cancer. Every time they tell me a funny story about him I feel like someone has landed a solid punch below my sternum. The wind just goes out and try as I might I cannot hold back the overwhelming feeling that I’ve been replaced. I know he isn’t Daddy. I just spent the whole week on vacation with my kids and I know they love me. They are special and they make me feel the same. I’ve lost family and friends. I’ve known some heartache. I got past all of those things. I know I’ll get past these feelings too, but it sure doesn’t feel like it right now. Hug and kiss your kids. Tell them you love them until they are sick of it and then tell them again. There will be a day when you aren’t with them every day. That day comes too soon.
