Jeep's truck frame based Wagoneer and Grand Wagonner are getting a new design for 2022. [Design News has slides showcasing the new design][1]. I've always liked the Wagoneer and this iteration is no exception. It has a solid frame, agressive stance, and fairly wide wheel base. The 2022 Wagoneer is gorgeous outside and internally. It is a modern automobile with a nice retro aesthetic.
