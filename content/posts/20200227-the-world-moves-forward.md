Over the past few days the number of questions I receive regarding the COVID-19 virus have increased. People are interested and/or worried about how the virus will affect supply chains, the stock market, their lives. There have been disruptions in my company's supply chain. The stock market is volatile. All global events effect us. 

Horace Dediu argued some of these points from the perspective of the technological markets in a [post][1] today.

>It’s not prudent to ignore a pandemic but it’s not prudent to contemplate an apocalypse will follow. Demand deferred is not demand destroyed. Civilization is fundamentally able to absorb these shocks and it’s useful to look to history to see exactly how we managed to do so.

History should teach us that pandemics come and go. Markets will rise and markets will fall. Life marches on.
