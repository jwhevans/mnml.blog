The kids and I kicked off the new year by building a [Stirling Cycle engine][3]. We used a 3D print kit from the excellent site [Kontax Stirling Engines][1]. Print files are available at [PrusaPrinters.org][2]. I modified the settings slightly. Print time was a little over 6 hours. The manual is well done. My seven year old was able to follow along with no issues. Our engine runs well. It will operate on the printer’s heat bed at 25°C above ambient. At 35°C above ambient it turns at approximately 120 rpm.
