This video from SmarterEveryDay is excellent. The rings produced at 4:32 are so satisfying. This is a classic experiment by T. Lim and T. Nichols in the early 1990s. It is an extremely difficult experiment. The vortex generators must be precisely aligned. There must be an undisturbed fluid. The magnitude of the vorticities and velocities must be equal and their directions must be opposite. The video gives a good explanation of the difficulties developing the apparatus and acheiving a result. When it works though, it is something to see. Secondary vortices curl off and out from the central vortices as they slowly breakdown.

The always great FYFluidDynamics also has video of the [original experiment][1]. If you enjoy fluid dynamics and aren't following this site, I recommend it.
