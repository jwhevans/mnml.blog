[Spaceflight Now][1] reports that SpaceX has successfully completed the final parachute test for Crew Dragon.

>SpaceX completed Friday the last drop test of the Dragon crew capsule’s parachutes before the first launch of astronauts on the human-rated ship May 27, while technicians at Cape Canaveral have mated the spacecraft’s crew module with its unpressurized trunk section.

I'm really excited to see the U.S. resume crewed flights from home. I hope all goes well.
