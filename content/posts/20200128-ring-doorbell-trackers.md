>[An investigation by EFF of the Ring doorbell app for Android found it to be packed with third-party trackers sending out a plethora of customersâ€™ personally identifiable information (PII). Four main analytics and marketing companies were discovered to be receiving information such as the names, private IP addresses, mobile network carriers, persistent identifiers, and sensor data on the devices of paying customers.][1]

I wish that I was surprised. Unfortunately, this is the current norm for Amazon devices. I have previously written about my love for the Kindle Paperwhite. Unfortunately, it also tracks purchases and reading time.

I'm following [The Open Book Project][2] closely. The screen resolution is lacking, as of this writing, but it is promising.
