This is one of my more popular designs at [PrusaPrinters](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/105174-interlocking-stars-fidget-toy). The stars are customizable via an OpenSCAD script. All stars print in place such that they can move relatively freely but remain captured within each larger star. I saw something similar on Twitter. It was mesmerizing.
