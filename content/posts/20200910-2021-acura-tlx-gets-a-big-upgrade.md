The first car that I bought for myself was an Acura RSX Type S. It was a fun car and had good power for the investment. I really enjoyed it. Honda makes great engines and the 4-cylinder in the RSX was excellent. I probably would have been just as happy with a Civic though. I don’t think Honda does a good job of differentiating the Acura line from their generic platform siblings.

The recently announced Acura TLX breaks that mold. Honda is shaking up the design and incorporating new production technologies to create a car that should be a big step up from the Accord. [Design News][1] has some details on the new materials and processes that Honda is using. It’s a good looking car and if the claims in the article are true it will be a blast to drive.
