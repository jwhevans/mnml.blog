The SpaceX Starlink mission that was planned to launch Sunday May 17 was delayed due to weather in the Atlantic that would have affected first stage recovery efforts. The mission will be rescheduled sometime after the upcoming Crew Dragon launch. Crew Dragon is currently scheduled to fly on May 27 and will carry two astronauts to the International Space Station.
