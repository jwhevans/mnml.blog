Chaim Gartenberg reporting for [The Verge][1]

>Video game spending in the US reached its highest point since 2010, according to a new NPD Group report, with sales through June reaching $6.6 billion on hardware, software, and accessories. It’s the highest total for the first six months of the year since spending hit $7 billion a decade ago.

My family is spending more than normal on games of all types this year. I’m only surprised that this was not an all time record. I guess many are waiting for the new consoles to arrive this fall.
