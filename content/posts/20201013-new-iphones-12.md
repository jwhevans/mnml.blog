Apple announced some new products today including the iPhone(s) 12. As I previously mentioned, I'm using an iPhone 7 and am ready to upgrade. The rumors of a slightly smaller iPhone mini were true (approximately 3 mm in width and 6 mm in height than an iPhone 8/SE). I'll preorder one of those when they go on sale. I'm going to do something different this year though. All my iPhones have been black. I'm ordering the Pacific Blue version. It looks great.
