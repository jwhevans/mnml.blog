>This tale could be told of any beloved regional grocery store — your Publixes, your Wegmans, your Harris Teeters — except that San Antonio-based H-E-B exists in a single U.S. state (with 52 stores across the border in Mexico) and is the 12th-largest private company in the country, according to Forbes. What’s the difference between H-E-B and everyone else? Sure, it’s ranked among the top places to work and is pretty ahead-of-the-curve with its mobile checkout (maybe that’s why employees at Amazon suggested that the tech giant acquire H-E-B before it settled on that other Texas grocer).

We love H-E-B because it’s our store and it makes us feel at home. She goes on to write.

>If you’re not from Texas, the state might seem like one giant stereotype of cowboys, conservatism, and brashness. But Texan identity is more complex than that: There’s rural Texas, Silicon Prairie Texas, honky-tonk Texas, hipster Texas, Latinx Texas, oil-soaked Texas, Vietnamese Texas, and yes, gun-slinging Texas — just to name a few.

That’s all true. There are as many types of Texans as there are Texans. And no, we don’t all love the Dallas Cowboys. I’m sorry Grandma. As with any place or people you have to be there to truly appreciate them.

>I’ve noticed, living in New York, that people tend to write off Texas as a Wild West of conservatism and unruliness. Similarly, when my parents moved to Dallas from Nashua, New Hampshire in the ’90s, everyone told them they would face intense racism. Instead, we’ve all found the opposite to be true, at least where we’ve lived — Texans, on the whole, are open, honest, dedicated, and friendly. Maybe that’s why H-E-B resonates so strongly in Texas. The stores represent Texans as they see themselves. There is no attempt to construct a monolithic image of Texas — or even to help people outside of Texas understand Texas. H-E-B is the secret that only Texans are in on. It’s a retailer whose ethos is very clear: This is Texas — where the food is better, the people are more loyal, and the shape of our state is actually quite remarkable.

Living in Houston, I can say that people tend to write off New York for different, but equally erroneous reasons. You will meet extremely arrogant, rude, utterly New York, New Yorkers on the streets of Manhattan. However, most of the people I’ve met in New York are great. I’ve seen some unruly Texans (been there myself a few times). People are people. Most are good, honest, hardworking and have a good story to tell if you are willing to listen. We are Texas (tejas) and that means friend. Come see us. Most of us will buy you a Shiner Bock or Bishop’s Barrel #9 and some mean tacos al pastor. We might even pick up some ribs from H-E-B and show you how we smoke.

Btw, this article reminded me of something I saw recently that I just loved. [Why Houston is cool][2].
