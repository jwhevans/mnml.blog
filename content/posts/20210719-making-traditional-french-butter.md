This video tickles all my fancies. We see chemistry and physics, craftsmanship, passion, mechanics, and a sheer love of work and life. Someone could make a full documentary a la “Jiro Dreams of Sushi” here and I would gladly watch it.

From the always excellent blog [FYFD](https://fyfluiddynamics.com/2021/07/inside-old-fashioned-butter/).
