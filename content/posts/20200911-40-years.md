Forty years ago today at 3:57 am I popped into this world. When you are told how quickly time flies you never listen. It has been a quick forty. Despite the strange year I’m happy to be here. I’m a bit surprised that I made it, but I’m really glad that I did. Here’s to hoping the next forty are every bit as eventful and exciting as the first. Here’s to growing and learning more in the next forty.
