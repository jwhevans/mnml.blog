>*by Langston Hughes*
>
>Let America be America again.  
>Let it be the dream it used to be.  
>Let it be the pioneer on the plain  
>Seeking a home where he himself is free.  
>
>(America never was America to me.) 
>
>...
>
>O, let America be America again&mdash;  
>The land that never has been yet&mdash;  
>And yet must be&mdash;the land where *every* man is free.  
>The land that’s mine&mdash;the poor man’s, Indian’s,  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;Negro’s, ME&mdash;  
>Who made America,  
>Whose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain,  
>Whose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain,  
>Must bring back our mighty dream again. 
>
>...
>
>O, yes,  
>I say it plain,  
>America never was America to me,  
>And yet I swear this oath&mdash;  
>America will be!

I think this poem is still under copyright so I have not quoted it in full. The complete text is [here][1]. 

I love the hope evident in the words. We are taught that there was never a country quite like the United States. It is more than a people. It is more than land. It is a set of ideals. For our entire history a large portion of the American population have been denied the promise of America, but the promise still lives. America isn’t for the few. It isn’t for the privileged. It isn’t for any one group. It is for everyone that seeks life, liberty, and the right to pursue their happiness. America is for all. 

Until everyone that desires to be a part of this great experiment is truly equal under the law. Until they are all included and supported and able to live their lives without undue fear for their lives, families, and property then America has not arrived. Today, in 2020 America has not arrived, but it will. We will make it. America will be!
