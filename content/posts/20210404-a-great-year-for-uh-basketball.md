UH played a great season. Baylor proved to be too much yesterday evening. Baylor played a great game and there was no shame in the loss. The younger Cougars can learn from the game. Baylor beat us on defense, on offense, on the boards. Still we showed promise in the second half. Coach Sampson made good on his promise to the university. We are relevant again and I couldnâ€™t be prouder.
