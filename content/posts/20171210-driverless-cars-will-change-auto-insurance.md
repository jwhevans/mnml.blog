[Harvard Business Review][1] reports:

>In short, change is inevitable for auto insurers, but the change can be positive.

I love cars. I always have. I started counting down the days to my 16th birthday on my 8th birthday. There is no doubt in my mind that driverless cars are the future though. As the husband of a wife that cannot drive due to a disability, I welcome the coming revolution. Disruption is hard. There will be opportunities though.
