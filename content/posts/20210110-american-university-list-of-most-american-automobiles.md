Each year American University releases a list of automobiles ranked by total domestic content (TDC). [This yearâ€™s list][1] is available on their website. The 2020 Ford Ranger tops the list. Ford and GMC have the most automobiles on the list but Honda Motor Company is also well represented. The automobile industry utilizes a distributed and global supply chain so nothing is made 100% in America.
