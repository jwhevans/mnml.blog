Yesterday I recommended that the 3D printing community help the COVID effort by printing only proven, tested products that are fit for FFM/FDM process and fit for purpose. This article from [3DPrint.com][1] goes much further and offers good advice for workplace hygiene, printer setup, and material handling. If you are going to make anything that will be used by others, please read this first.

>There is this palpable feeling in the maker community and in 3D Printing companies that to do nothing at all would be the greatest sin. On the whole, that may be the case, but specifically, when making a product used in medicine, failure to observe safety requirements, standards, and best practices could mean that people who otherwise would live long lives could die because of your 3D printed product.
