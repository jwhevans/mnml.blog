The novel coronavirus is sparking debate nationally regarding vote from home or so called "mail in ballot" rules. Texas is no exception and the Texas Tribune recently reported that ["a group of Texas voters and civic organizations claim that four Texas absentee voting rules are unconstitutional during a public health crisis."][1]

This is not the only lawsuit challenging state rules for mail in voting. This particular suit deals with the structure of the system.

>First, they're challenging a requirement that voters pay postage to return mail-in ballots, arguing that it amounts to a poll tax during a public health crisis. Second, they're challenging a requirement that sets deadlines for when ballots must be postmarked and received, arguing that the window should be extended. Third, they object to a requirement for matching signatures on the flap of a ballot envelope and the signature used on an application to vote by mail, which they argue discriminates against voters with disabilities whose signatures may change. And fourth, they're challenging restrictions on the assistance absentee voters can get to return a marked ballot.

I personnally believe that we need to ensure all legal voters have a possibility to vote freely and with minimal friction. I have not voted by mail recently so I cannot comment on the current situation. I regularly voted by mail while in college and it was a headache. If it is a pain for a healthy 20 something then the system is not serving the elderly or those with disabilities.
