>**5.** The Arctic Ocean is now so warm that its floating sea ice can melt even during the [coldest, darkest times][2] of the year.
>
>**15.** People with autism are [10 times as likely][3] to die by suicide as those in the general population.
>
>**18.** Ten thousand years ago, the people who lived in Europe had [dark skin and blue eyes][4].
>
>**41.** The fastest someone has ever hiked all 2,189 miles of the Appalachian Trail is 41 days, seven hours, and 39 minutes. That [averages out][5] to roughly two marathons a day.
