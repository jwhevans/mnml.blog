Within the past week at least two White House staff with close ties to the President and Vice President have tested positive for COVID-19. The daily press events are always painful, but the past few have been inciteful for one reason. President Trump has mentioned regularly how often the affected members of his staff were tested. It is clear that the staff at the White House are tested often. We all know this is the right course of action. Despite my disdain for Mr. Trump, he holds our highest office. We need to do our best to ensure a continuity of governance. What is happening at the White House is diametrically opposed to what we are being told in the briefings each day. The White House line is "testing doesn't work. This isn't that big of deal. We need to open the economy." Donald Trump is not our leader. He is the "do as I say, not as I do" President.
