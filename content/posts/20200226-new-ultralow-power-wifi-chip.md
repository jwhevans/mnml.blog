The University of California at San Diego reports that they have developed a new ultra-low power WiFi chip that utilizes a unique backscattering method to piggyback on existing WiFi signals.

>[The device, which is housed in a chip smaller than a grain of rice, enables Internet of Things (IoT) devices to communicate with existing Wi-Fi networks using 5,000 times less power than todayâ€™s Wi-Fi radios. It consumes just 28 microwatts of power. And it does so while transmitting data at a rate of 2 megabits per second (a connection fast enough to stream music and most YouTube videos) over a range of up to 21 meters.][1]

This could enable more connected wearables and IoT devices. Radios are traditionally power hungry. This device could run for months or even years on a standard coin cell battery.
