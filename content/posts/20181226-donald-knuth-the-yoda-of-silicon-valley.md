>For half a century, the Stanford computer scientist Donald Knuth, who bears a slight resemblance to Yoda — albeit standing 6-foot-4 and wearing glasses — has reigned as the spirit-guide of the algorithmic realm.

Dr. Knuth is a giant and his algorithms touch many fields. This is a nice profile of someone that also seems like a genuine human.
