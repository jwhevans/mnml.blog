Last month I purchased a [Prusa i3 MK3S 3D printer][1] in kit form. It is an excellent kit and was a complete joy to assemble. After I received it I quickly fell down the rabbit hole and have been busy upgrading the system. 3D printing is an interesting and fun technology. I find that I utilize my creativity more now that I can test ideas almost immediately.

Prusa is a great company. I'm happy that I purchased one of their kits as my introduction to printing. There are many sites online that host makers and 3D models that make it easy to download and print. Prusa is also building a community. You can find me there. I'm [mnmlMaker][2]. We have also started [The Houston Area Printers Group][3]. The group is primarily for makers in the greater Houston, Texas area but everyone is welcome. Come join us.

**Communities**

If you are interested in 3D printing or have recently purchased a printer and are looking for inspiration I suggest you check out [PrusaPrinters.org][4] and the following links:

- [Thingiverse][5]
- [MyMiniFactory][6]
- [Pinshape][7]

After you get a few prints under your belt you may want to design your own items or modify existing designs. 

**Design Software**

There are many 3D design options available. Software prices range from free to many hundreds of dollars. Note that free does not equate to bad quality. There are excellent open-source CAD packages that are free, actively developed, and supported by a strong community. I have worked with many 2D and 3D CAD packages in my career. However, I'm always most comfortable with the command-line and scripting (blame it on AutoCAD R12). I mainly design in OpenSCAD and CADQuery.

- [OpenSCAD][8]
- [CADQuery][9] / [CQ-Editor (GUI)][10]
- [FreeCAD][11]
- [MeshMixer][12] is useful for fixing broken .stl files
- [Fusion 360][13] $$$$ but free for students, educators, and small businesses (with some caveats)
  
**Next Steps**

As with any hobby you will find that you are only limited by your time and creativity. As I previously stated, I've really felt a boost to my creativity since I added printing capabilities to my repetoire. Rapid prototyping means I can test many more ideas and iterate more quickly. I have no doubt that you will see the same benefits.

One final addition that greatly improved my printing experience was [OctoPrint][14]. Octoprint can run on a RaspberryPi or other single board computer (SBC). It sets up a highly customizable web interface for your printer. You can also add a webcam so that you can create mesmerizing timelapse videos of your prints.

If you are interested in 3D printing but haven't taken the plunge I suggest you try it. You will be glad that you did. If you are already travelling this road, Happy Printing!
