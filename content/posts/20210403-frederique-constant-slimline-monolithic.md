[Gear Patrol][1] recently showcased a new watch designed by Swiss watchmaker Frederique Constant. The [Slimline Monolithic Manufacture][2] watch has a balance wheel made from silicon. The mechanism is 0.3 mm thin and replaces 26 components from the company's traditional balance wheel design. It is an interesting design and a nice way of incorporating new material technology into traditional mechanical movements. The price is also a relative bargain for steel versions, starting at $4750 USD.
