Earlier this month Nick Maggiulli published [“How Big is the Racial Wealth Gap?”][1]. He argues that the social inequalities that we see across races in the United States are real, but that economic inequality plays a significant role.

>I see discriminatory acts both large and small that have added up over decades and decades to leave the typical Black household in the U.S. at a far worse starting point than the typical White household.
>
>For example, say someone is prevented from buying a home in a certain area because of their race.  Imagine how that might affect the quality of their children’s education and their children’s lifetime income.  As I have written about before, even a small change in initial conditions can affect where you end up in life.  And that is just one racist act one time.

Our world is driven by money. You may think that is great or you may think it is horrible. Regardless of your view, it is true. Money drives our economy and bestows power on the people that have it.

>Don’t believe me?  Consider what Martin Luther King Jr. said on the Tonight Show in February 1968:
>>The economic problem is probably the most serious problem confronting the Negro community, and, I might say, the most serious problem confronting poor people generally.
>
>Why did he say this?  Probably because he recognized the utmost importance of money in our society. 

How do we get money into the hands of those that need it the most. It isn’t an easy task because the people that have it are going to fight like hell to keep it. I agree with Mr. Maggiulli though. If we want to have a more socially equitable society we must build systems that create more economic equality.

>As Chamath Palihapitiya, founder and CEO of Social Capital, explained:
>>Get the fuckin’ money.  I’m serious…Get it.  It is going to be made.  It is going to be allocated.  And you have a moral imperative to make sure that, if you have a point of that matters and you wanna reflect it, you get it. 
>>
>>I’m gonna go get it.  Other people are gonna go get it.  Then it will be about a competition of views…In the absence of capital you’re irrelevant.  With capital, you’re powerful.  And then you decide.
