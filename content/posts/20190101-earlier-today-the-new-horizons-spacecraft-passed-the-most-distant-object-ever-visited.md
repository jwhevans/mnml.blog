Earlier Today the New Horizons Spacecraft Passed the Most Distant Object Ever Visited

News Release from [NASA New Horizons][1]:

>NASA's New Horizons spacecraft flew past Ultima Thule in the early hours of New Year's Day, ushering in the era of exploration from the enigmatic Kuiper Belt, a region of primordial objects that holds keys to understanding the origins of the solar system."
>
>Congratulations to NASA's New Horizons team, Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and the Southwest Research Institute for making history yet again. In addition to being the first to explore Pluto, today New Horizons flew by the most distant object ever visited by a spacecraft and became the first to directly explore an object that holds remnants from the birth of our solar system," said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. "This is what leadership in space exploration is all about."

What a way to ring in the New Year! Ultima Thule is approximately 4 billion miles from the Sun (that’s about the same as 1,630,000 trips from Los Angeles to New York). It’s difficult for me to comprehend how the spacecraft could survive so long. It was launched in 2006. Nor can I imagine the difficulty that goes into mission planning when your robot is 4 billion miles away and both it and its targets are moving at 1000s of miles per hour.
