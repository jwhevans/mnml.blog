[Jamil Smith][1] writing in The Rolling Stone,

>But Americans need look no further, if they can stomach it, than the videos of Floyd’s murder for evidence of how corrosive racism can be. Despite the Floyd family wanting escalated charges against Chauvin that reflect intention, it is more disturbing to consider that the former officer may not have intended to kill, but simply didn’t care whether or not Floyd died. Chauvin nonchalantly kept his hands in his pockets while his knee pressed the life out of Floyd. It only underscores the irrelevance of intention when committing a racist act. You don’t have to hate people. Racism means that you likely don’t consider them to be people in the first place.

I can’t watch this or any other video of senseless violence. I inadvertently saw the Ahmaud Arbery video. I have a rage disorder. I take medication for it, but scenes like that are more than I can handle. My blood pressure spikes and I lose complete control of my mind. There have been times in my life when I’ve acted out during an episode like that with disastrous consequences.

Acting without thinking is dangerous. I don’t want to imply that all racists are acting from their subconscious. There are many evil racists that are using their brains and influence actively to promote their beliefs. They are horrible people. There are far more people that are unconscious racists. It has been a part of our culture and the society around them for so long that it is ingrained in who they are. They don’t see people of color as equal. They see the world as us and them. The problem I see is that all of us are products of this system. We all have the propensity to make the same unconscious mistakes.

I hope that none of my friends and neighbors reading this actively condone the intolerable acts of racism and cruelty that we have seen throughout American history and the American present. We need to stand against this evil but never forget that we are a product of this culture and susceptible to the same faults. Be present. Be conscious.
