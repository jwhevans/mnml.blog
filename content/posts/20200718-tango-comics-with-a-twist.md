I recently ran across [these wonderful comics by Gao Youjun][1].

![Tango Comic](/img/tango-13.jpg)

>Tango is also known as Shanghai Tango and Tango Sleepless. However, his real name is Gao Youjun. He now has over 229k Instagram followers, up from 108k the last time we wrote about him a year and a half ago.
>
>The artist graduated from the Mathematics Department of Shanghai Jiao Tong University but he realized that he’d much rather be an artist than a scientist. So he went for it and finished his Master’s degree at the Academy of Arts & Design.
