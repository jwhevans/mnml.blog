I proofread all posts several times prior to publishing. However, grammatical and spelling errors do make it through the process. It is difficult to proofread oneâ€™s own writing. I appreciate any feedback regarding these errors. Special thanks to Nicole who has noticed several problems. You are now my unofficial editor in chief.
