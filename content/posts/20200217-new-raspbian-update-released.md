[A new version of the Raspbian operating system is available for Raspberry Pi.][1] This is the first major update since Raspbian Buster was released alongside the Raspberry Pi 4 last year. The update includes

- Changes to the file manager
- Fixes to the Orca screen reader accessibility features
- Updates to Scratch 3 including new Sense HAT blocks
- Improvements to the Thonny IDE
- Source code for Python games from Eben's *Code the Classics Volume 1*
- Other audio/visual adjustments and bug fixes

I rarely use the GUI but the changes to Scratch and the inclusion of source code for some classic games is interesting and should be fun for the kids. A new image is available via the Raspberry Pi [Downloads Page][2] or you can update directly in the terminal

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt full-upgrade
