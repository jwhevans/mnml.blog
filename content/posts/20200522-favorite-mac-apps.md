## Read

### [NetNewsWire][1]

Everything I wrote yesterday regarding NetNewsWire for iOS is true in NetNewsWire for Mac. I have used RSS readers for as long as I can remember. I prefer to curate my own sources of information and to read outside of the slow loading, tracking intensive web. NetNewsWire has been around in different forms for a long time. This version is new but still familiar. It is created as a labor of love and that love shows in every detail.

### [Micro.blog][2]

I prefer Micro.blog to Twitter. Twitter is rush hour traffic in Houston. Micro.blog is weekend grilling with the neighbors. I guess this is the *official* app for Micro.blog. It has a nice interface and keeps the content front and center.

## Write

### [BBEdit][3]

The developer says It doesn't suck.&reg; That is an understatement. At 25 years and counting BBEdit is an app that has stood the test of time. It is an extraordinary editor for writers, coders, anyone. It is the most well documented application I've ever seen. I barely scratch the surface of its capabilities. A recent addition added a grep or regular expression playground. I write many python scripts at work that use regular expressions to translate different Gcode implementations between machines. The playground feature has saved me countless hours debugging edge cases. I wish I had this tool years ago. As far as I am concerned a Mac without BBEdit is not a useful device.

## Work

### [NotePlan][4]

I made a short case for NotePlan in my list of favorite iOS apps yesterday. Nothing is different on the Mac. This is a great app that works on top of 100% plain text. Your data is not siloed. It remains available for you to edit in another app or take with you to any system you choose. I definitely need to discuss my workflow for this app at length. It is just phenomenal.

### [PCalc][5]

Once again, is another calculator really necessary on that powerful Mac sitting in front of you. I would argue that it is, and that the calculator you should choose is PCalc. I'm being a bit facetious. You really do need a good calculator. I'm certain of it. Then again, maybe I just love calculators.

### [Outlook][6]

It's a solid email client with support for most major email systems. It has useful features like focused inboxes and none of the gimmicks like email snoozing. The search function works really well. It's boring, just like email, but it works and doesn't glitch unlike a certain first party solution.

### [Fantastical][7]

By this point you may feel like you already took this class last year. Apparently, good app developers on one platform make good apps on other platforms as well. Fantastical is great on the Mac. The menu bar helper is always available for quick schedule checks and updates. The default calendar app is fine, but after using Fantastical for a week I doubt many would give up its ease of use and powerful feature set.

### [VS Code][8]

Finally, something different. VS Code is the place where I write most of my code. For several years Atom was my favorite editor but I've switched entirely to VS Code. It has good support for git baked in. It has a strong ecosystem of plugins in the VS Code Marketplace. It is easy to find useful plugins that are well maintained. As I mentioned earlier I have to maintain code on production equipment from many manufacturers. The underlying operating system might be Windows 98 (I'm not making that up), PCU 20, some flavor of Linux, or a newer Windows version. VS Code shows me encoding immediately for every file as well as the style of newline and end of file characters. It is very easy to ruin good parts because of seemingly innocuous, invisible characters. I also write a lot of python and Microsoft's python team is building a great ecosystem for python programming in VS Code.

## Play

### [OpenSCAD][9]

OpenSCAD is a free and open source solid modeling software. It bills itself as the programmer's 3D modeller. Models are created through a scripting language rather than object manipulation via the cursor. OpenSCAD runs on top of [CGAL][10]. The OpenSCAD language wraps CGAL up into a simple set of functions that can be strung together in a way that any programmer will understand almost immediately. There is also a vibrant community of Makers and Programmers that use and support OpenSCAD through development of shared models and libraries that extend OpenSCAD's features. You can find these resources on [Thingiverse][11] and [Github][12] or search for OpenSCAD in DuckDuckGo.

### [PrusaSlicer][13]

A typical 3D printing workflow is as follows. Design a piece. Save that piece in a suitable format. This is often .stl, .obj, .3mf. Slice the file to generate Gcode. Upload the GCode to a printer and make the part. Slicing breaks down a model file into a list of many thousands of linear movements that are passed to servo motors. I'm getting off topic. I like PrusaSlicer. There are several good ones. Cura is solid. Kisslicer is ok. Sli3r is the foundation that PrusaSlicer was forked from and is also good. PrusaSlicer was missing some features but is improving all the time and it has excellent infill parameterization.

## Utilities

### [1Password][14]

I truly believe that everyone should use a password manager. Strong passwords are not a cure-all but they are a good first line of defense in the battle to protect your data. I like the features in 1Password and the way it integrates with Safari on the Mac.

### [Mullvad][15]

There are many reasons to have a VPN. You may want to hide your traffic from your ISP. This is particulary important if your ISP is AT&T. Their published retention policy for your data is forever. You may be using an unsecure network and want to protect yourself from a malicious person snooping on you. There are also many factors to consider when choosing a VPN. You are trusting them to abide by their terms of service and you are funneling all of your internet traffic through their servers. I spent countless evenings researching VPNs, reading their terms of service, and reading reviewerâ€™s comments. It is difficult to choose. Many reviewers are paid by the VPNs. One thing is clear. If you are not paying for your VPN then your data is not safe. If you need a VPN I suggest you start [here][16]. I have used Mullvad for two years and currently believe they are the best option.

### [Downlink][17]

Downlink is a simple app that lives in your menubar. It has one function. It regularly updates you desktop background with real-time satellite imagery of the earth. If you are a space nerd then this app is for you.

### [Mojibar][18]

The emoji picker in Messages is great. It is located directly next to the text input field and it has search capabilites. By the way, why can't we search for emoji in iOS? Outside of Messages adding emoji is harder. Mojibar is another menubar app. It gives you quick search, select, copy, and paste of emoji into any app. It is one of the things I launch at startup and I use it all the time.

### [Sleep No More][19]

Macs are aggressive when it comes to energy efficiency. Sometimes you just want your Mac to stay awake. Sleep No More is a very pretty menubar app that does just that. Click, set a time and your Mac stays awake. I don't know how long I have had this app and I don't know if it is still actively maintained. The only link I can find to it is quite old.
