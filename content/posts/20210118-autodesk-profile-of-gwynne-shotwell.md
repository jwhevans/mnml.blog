Since we are already considering women who make stuff let’s talk about Gwynne Shotwell. She is a mechanical engineer with a long history in the aerospace industry and she is currently the COO of SpaceX. The [Autodesk Fusion 360 blog][1] recently published a profile of her and I found it interesting. 

One thing they didn’t mention is how she manages to indulge Elon Musk’s fantasy while keeping him out of the day to day operations of SpaceX. We’ve all seen what a mess he can make in a company. She’s found a way to keep him involved while not allowing him to make a mess of things. There is bound to be a useful book that could be written about the interactions between those two.
