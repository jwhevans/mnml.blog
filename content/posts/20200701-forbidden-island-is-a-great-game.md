I really enjoy playing games with my kids. I don’t play video games with them often. I’ve always preferred dominoes, board games and the like. My kids range from 11 to 4. Currently it is hard to find a game that everyone can enjoy. I bought [Forbidden Island][1] recently and we have enjoyed it. The game is meant for 2 to 4 players and is recommended for players 10 and up. My 6 year old picked up the game quickly and loves it. My 4 year old understands the mechanics but cannot understand the strategy. We make up for this by playing as a 5 person team. I play along with the four kids.

The game begins as a set of 24 randomly placed tiles representing the Forbidden Island. The goal of the game is to collect four treasures by acquiring the associated treasure cards. Players can cooperate by sharing treasure cards. After all treasures are collected, all players must get off the island by making it back to a helicopter landing pad. Then one player must play a helicopter card. After each player’s turn spaces on the island become flooded. It is also possible for flooded spaces to sink and disappear forever. So players must actively shore up the flooded areas.

I have two extremely competitive children so games often lead to hurt feelings and the inevitable talk about good sportsmanship, etc. We haven’t run into that issue with Forbidden Island. We win or lose together. There is a game mechanic to increase the difficulty also. This keeps Daddy interested. If your family enjoys games I highly recommend Forbidden Island.
