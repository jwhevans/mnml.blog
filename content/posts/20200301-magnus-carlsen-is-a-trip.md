Magnus Carlsen, currently the world's highest ranked chess player, is playing speed chess online under various pseudonyms. He also streams many games, and he is hilarious.

If you are at all interested in chess then give this story from [Slate][1] a read.

>One of the sweetest benefits of watching these matches is enjoying Carlsen’s dry, self-deprecating sense of humor—something no chess prodigy has any right to have. In a match with a FIDE master—a skills designation a notch below international master—Carlsen’s camera froze midstream. “I promised I would fix the problems, and I didn’t,” he said. “I am a pathological liar. I cannot blame my parents; they raised me well. It’s just me.”

😂 😂 😂
