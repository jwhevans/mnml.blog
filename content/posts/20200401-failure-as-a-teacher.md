I enjoyed this article from [Hackaday][1] regarding the importance of modeling all aspects of a design, including the environment.

>The failure was a stand for a screwdriver set, shown above. He modeled up a simple stand to hold a screwdriver handle and the bits in a nice, tight formation. He didnâ€™t model any of parts, he just took some measurements and designed the holder. Everything fit just fine, but it had a major ergonomic problem: you can barely reach the handle because it is fenced in by the surrounding bits! Had he modeled all of the parts during the design phase, and not just the part he was making, this problem would have been immediately obvious during the design phase.

Many years ago I was tasked to design a workholding fixture that would clamp a part during a turning operation. I was excited because there were no "off the shelf" solutions available. I put every bit of my creativity to work on the challenge and came up with a great looking design. I took it to my manager, who had over 40 years of experience. Unlike previous discussions, he looked it over quickly, said "It looks great", and then told me to "go make it". If I was an older man, I would have gone back to my desk. Instead I ran to the shop, commandeered a machine and started fabrication. It wasn't until the next day that I realized my mistake. One of the locating holes for my "ingenious" clamping connection were impossible to manufacture.

It was a humbling experience. I modified the design over the next two days. The final design was manufactured and served us well for several years. I have never designed another part that could not be manufactured. That is probably just dumb luck, but I like to think it was because this experience taught me to be more critical.

All of this reminds me of the quote attributed to Steve Jobs that, "design is not how it looks, it is how it works". I believe that whole-heartedly. Elegance is also functional.
