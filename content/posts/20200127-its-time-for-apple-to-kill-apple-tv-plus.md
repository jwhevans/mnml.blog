John Koetsier writing for [Forbes][1] states:

>Apple TV+ is DOA, and the sooner Apple realizes it, the sooner the company will stop wasting billions of dollars chasing failure.

I don't know if Apple TV+ is DOA, but anecdotal evidence says it is quite successful given its limited offerings. Of course it is currently available for free to almost all subscribers. Apple is very good at developing lock-in and I expect that a majority of subscribers will simply pay the $5 per month fee when it kicks in next year.

His argument that the Apple TV (hardware) vs Apple TV (software) vs Apple TV+ (service) is confusing to customers is true. Apple has created a nightmare here and I hope they find a way to clean it up.

>The idea that Apple could be the next Netflix? That seems like it will be as long-lived as the exceedingly short period of time my family spent watching See, the biggest Apple-exclusive show on Apple TV+. 

I'm not sure that See is "the biggest Apple-exclusive show". "The Morning Show" has been nominated and won awards this season. I particularly enjoyed "For All Mankind". It seems premature to compare the offerings on Apple TV+ to established players. As Mr. Koetsier noted, Apple is throwing enormous amounts of money at this "problem" and I would argue that they are doing so in a very strategic way.

It is fun to spend Apple's money, but telling Apple that "the problem is simple" is no different from telling an engineer that the solution is simple. Tim Cook and company have created one of the greatest cash generators in history. They know a thing or two about these things. If I remember correctly some people thought that Apple wouldn't figure out phones. I wouldn't bet against them figuring out media production.

By the way, Netflix was not a media production powerhouse a decade ago either.
