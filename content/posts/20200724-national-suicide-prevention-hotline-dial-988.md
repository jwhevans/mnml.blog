>On Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission voted unanimously to finalize 988 as the number Americans can call to be directed to the 24/7 National Suicide Prevention Lifeline hotline. As of right now, individuals in suicidal crisis can reach that hotline by dialing 1-800-273-8255 (TALK), but that number will be easier to remember once it transitions to its three-digit equivalent starting on July 16th, 2022.

First, this is a great idea because in a crisis you need something that is quick to dial and easy to remember. I suffer from depression. I’ve been very lucky in that I have not had a major depressive episode in three years. I hope that I never have one again, but I know that the odds are not on my side. Three years ago I needed help and I needed it fast. If it were not for caring family, friends, and doctors I would not be here today. I wish they would accelerate the timeline for the rollout.

Second, we need more programs available under these quick dial actions. The past few months have shown us that police departments are all too often called to deal with situations that they are ill-suited to handle. The major reason for this is that we have overfunded our police forces and underfunded social services. We need to alleviate that issue for sure but another problem is that it is easy to call 911 for an emergency. The marketing is great. We all know it. We teach it to our kids from an early age. 

In Houston we have 311 for electrical emergencies. It is critical for elderly people that lose power and/or air conditioning in the summer months. We have 811 for gas line safety. Call and someone will be out to mark your underground utilities before you start a project. Most people don’t know about these because they are new and they have not been marketed like 911.

I would like to see an expansion of systems like these to help people in need find the correct services that they need. We will all benefit.
