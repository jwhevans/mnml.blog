FDM printers are basically very accurate programmable robots with an attached extruder. One of the guiding ideas for 3D printing and the RepRap movement was to build tools that could duplicate themselves. This is one of the better extensions of 3D printing that I have seen. The tool is used to create tooling, fixtures, and parts. Then the same tool is programmed to use those tools and fixtures to assemble the parts. This is truly a replicator.
