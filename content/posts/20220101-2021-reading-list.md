I planned to read two books per month this year. I fell a bit short. I completed "The Expanse" series. It was excellent throughout. I read a bit about Iceland after a wonderful trip to the country in August. As usual I bought more books than I finished so I have a backlog going into the new year. Books remain a guilty pleasure. I like the way they look and feel. I continue to read far more periodicals and technical writing for work than what I read for pleasure. Maybe those items are pleasurable as well. I read a fair amount with my kids. I've included a couple of exceptional books that I read with them as well. <!--more-->
