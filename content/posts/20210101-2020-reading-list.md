I intended to read a little more this year. The coronavirus pandemic gave me an opportunity but I invested in a 3D printer and threw myself into a new hobby instead. #4 is part of a children’s series. We have several of the Pigeon books now. My kids love them. If you haven’t read “The Chain”, pick it up as soon as possible. Most of the links below are to my Bookshop.org site. If you want to read any of these books and feel like offsetting my hosting costs you can purchase through the site. If you don’t, I won’t know the difference.

2. [Babylon’s Ashes (Expanse #6)][2]
3. [Rumple Buttercup: A Story of Bananas, Belonging, and Being Yourself][3]
4. [The Pigeon Has to Go to School!][4]
5. [How To Be An Antiracist][5]
