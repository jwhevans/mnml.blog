![Modular Lamp](/img/modular-lamp-bugman.jpeg)

My girlfriend thinks that it is important to have lamps near the bed for reading. I tried to argue that it is not necessary because I use my Kindle Paperwhite in bed. After 40 years I am still dumb enough to argue with a woman. I came across a nice print by Big Nick Dimelow aka [Bugman_140][1]. Bugman has some amazing designs. I love looking at his work. 

I like this concept because lamp shades can be changed easily for different occasions or different rooms. I made this shade using vase mode printing on a Prusa MK3S with CC3D White PLA+ filament. The wavy look is even better in person. The print files are available at [PrusaPrinters][2].
