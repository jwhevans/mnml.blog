INEOS has released the exterior design for their upcoming 4x4, The Grenadier. [The Engineer][1] has some more details.

>“The brief was simple. We set out to design a modern, functional and highly capable 4×4 vehicle with utility at its core”, said Toby Ecuyer, Head of Design. “A design that is ‘easy-to-read’, with no ambiguity about the Grenadier’s role in life.  There to do everything you need, and nothing you don’t. Nothing is for show. Modern engineering and production techniques ensure the Grenadier is highly capable, but we have been able to stay true to the essence of creating a utilitarian vehicle that will stand the test of time.”

A lot of people think it looks like a Land Rover. I can see the resemblance but the lines are sharper, more rugged. I love the hood. It reminds me of some classic FJ hoods. I think it’s a winner.
