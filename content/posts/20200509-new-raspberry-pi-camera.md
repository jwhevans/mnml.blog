The new Raspberry Pi ["High Quality Camera Module"][1] is so cool. I have no idea what to do with it, but I want to make something. Maybe a motion activated shooter for the local wildlife while I'm at work? Maybe a moon camera on a tracking tripod? So many possibilities.

Btw, using a mount for C and CS lenses was a good design choice.
