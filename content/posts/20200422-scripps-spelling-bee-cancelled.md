The [AP reports][1] that the Scripps National Spelling Bee has been cancelled for the first time since 1945 due to the COVID-19 virus.

>The bee will return next year, Scripps said, but thatâ€™s little comfort to the eighth-graders who are missing out on their last shot at the national stage. Scripps will not change eligibility requirements for the next bee, which is scheduled for June 1-3, 2021. The bee, which began in 1925 and was last canceled from 1943-45 because of World War II, has always been restricted to elementary and middle-schoolers.

I would guess that many of us took part in preliminary rounds of the Scripps spelling bee when we were young. I never made it past my local competition, but it is a big deal for some of these kids. It's too bad that they will not get a chance to compete.
