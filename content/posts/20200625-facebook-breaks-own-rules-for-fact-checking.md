[Popular Information][1] has published an excellent article about an internal change to Facebook's fact checking policy that allows for the spread of misinformation under the guise of opinion pieces.

The article quotes Robert Brulle, an environmental sociologist at Drexel University. With respect to Facebook

>“They have become the vehicle for climate misinformation, and thus should be held partially responsible for a lack of action on climate change.”

Per the article, Facebook's fact checking policy is outsourced to certified third parties and concerns or appeals by publishers should go to the third party. Facebook should be a neutral party. Apparently, the rule does not apply to Mark Zuckerberg.

>Instead, an organization affiliated with Michaels, the CO2 Coalition, wrote Zuckerberg and complained about Science Feedback's rating. Among other things, the coalition claims that Science Feedback's analysis amounted to "simple differences of opinion." The coalition asked Zuckerberg to "remove Facebook’s censorship, labeling, and restrictions on this article." 

Facebook removed an independent fact check label for the CO2 coalition unilaterally. Now there seems to be an unwritten exemption for content that Facebook employees deem to be an opinion piece.

Mark Zuckerberg has argued that Facebook is a content platform and cannot be held accountable for the work published on the platform. If this is true then Facebook must truly serve as a platform. In this instance they are serving as a publisher and an editorial board. There is clear evidence that the CO2 coalition article was not an opinion piece. It was a shoddy piece of amateur writing that used actual scientific data but arrived at wrong conclusions. Facts are clearly presented in the piece, but the facts are false.

Labeling the CO2 Coalition article as opinion is disingenuous. Claiming to be a neutral content platform while making decisions regarding the classification of content is also disingenous. Facebook know the difference between facts and opinion. I think Mark Zuckerberg should be removed as the CEO of Facebook (opinion). Facebook is a criminal enterprise (fact &mdash; possibly false, but I doubt it).
