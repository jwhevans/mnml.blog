📺 Last week was a non-stop chaotic mess. On Friday night I decided it was time to turn off and tune out. I found *Guns Akimbo* on Amazon Prime starring Daniel Radcliffe. It is a silly, trashy, vulger, and outright fun film. I find Mr. Radcliffe's choices interesting. He can do anything after the Harry Potter franchise and he chooses some odd projects. *Guns Akimbo* isn't a great film even within it's genre, but it was exactly what I was looking for. This was a fun break from reality. ★★★☆☆ 🍿
