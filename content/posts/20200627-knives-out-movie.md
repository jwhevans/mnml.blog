📺 I watched “Life Itself” on Amazon Prime Video last night. I normally prefer comedy but the combination of Oscar Isaac and Olivia Wilde drew me in. It started out strange. Then it got really good, before bouncing back and forth between great and just good. It ended well though. It's worth a watch when you are in the mood for a tearjerker. ★★★★☆ 🍿
