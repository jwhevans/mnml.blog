🏈 It’s NFL Conference Championship weekend and the road to the SuperBowl runs through Green Bay. This is the fourth NFC Championship game for the Packers since 2014. No other NFC team has been in more than one. Unfortunately, we haven’t made the SuperBowl since 2010. Maybe today is the day. I’m excited. Packers nation is excited. Go Pack Go!
