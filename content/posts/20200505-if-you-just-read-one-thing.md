Sometimes I'm asked the one thing that I feel is either most important for young students to learn or put another way, the one thing I feel they should learn but don't. The answer is always exponential growth and decay.

It is not a hard concept to understand. It is not necessary to teach them calculus first. Anyone that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide can understand it. The reason I think this is so important is because it affects us everyday in various ways and it is misunderstood by a large portion of the population. 

Almost every day I hear about something growing exponentially. Both exponential growth and exponential decay are exciting, and scary. The first thing I ask when I hear these claims is "what is the doubling/halving period". If there is a block of uranium in my basement the halving time is quite low and the block is going to be "hot" for a long time. If my 401(k) has the same doubling period as the half-life of uranium my retirement is shot.

The next thing that crosses my mind is "what are the factors affecting and/or limiting" this growth/decay. In the case of the uranium, the process is governed by physics, and there is little I can do to affect it. In the case of my 401(k) the amount and frequency of deposits as well as the type of investments I make affect the outcome.

All of this is a long introduction to the post [What Happens Next?][1]. I could watch the simulations on this page all day. The authors do a wonderful job of walking us through the development and understanding of the "Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered" (SEIR) model in epidemiology. It is a great visual tool to show how exponential growth and decay work. The simulations teach so much about the current situation and why small interventions such as washing hands and wearing masks are so effective.

I know this is well understood at the CDC the NIH and other public health institutes. I wish it was understood in Congress and the White House.
