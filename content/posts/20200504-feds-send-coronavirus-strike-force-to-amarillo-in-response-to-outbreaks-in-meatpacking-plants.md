Potter and Moore county in the Texas Panhandle have a COVID infection rate approximately four times that of Harris and Dallas counties, home to Houston and Dallas respectively. The [Texas Tribune][1] reports

>A federal strike force is headed to Amarillo in response to a surge of coronavirus cases tied to meatpacking plants in the area.
>
>Amarillo Mayor Ginger Nelson announced on Saturday that a team of federal officials would arrive in the Texas Panhandle as soon as Sunday to help "attack" outbreaks in the plants and take over testing and investigations of people contracting the new coronavirus.

I grew up in the Texas Panhandle and have family living and working in both counties. I talked to a few of them regarding this report and some other things come to light.  Part of the reason for the higher infection rate is the relative size of the counties. 600-700 cases in Potter county is staggeringly high “per capita” compared to Houston. So an outbreak in  beef packing facility in Moore county may infect the same number of people as an outbreak in a similar sized facility near Houston, but the rate is much higher in Moore county. However, something else is happening in these counties. The rate of testing per capita is also much higher than in Harris and Dallas counties. I wonder if the infection rate is really higher. I think it is more likely that the larger counties are undercounting.
