Berkeley has released a nice introduction to numerical methods using Python, [“Python Programming And Numerical Methods: A Guide For Engineers And Scientists”][1]. If you are looking for a book that will get you up to speed quickly on Python but also serves as a reference for more advanced topics this book will work well for you. Engineers and scientists will find this reference handy. The second half of the book reviews linear algebra and matrix manipulation in Python and walks through all the numerical methods I learned at university, plus a few more.

The code is available on Github and the book is available as a .pdf download or as an interactive Jupyter notebook.
