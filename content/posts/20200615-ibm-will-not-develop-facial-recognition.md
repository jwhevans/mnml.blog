On June 8, 2020 IBM's CEO Arvind Krishna sent a letter to Congress that was also published on the company's ["THINKPolicy Blog"][1].

The letter points to some actions taken by IBM to promote equal opportunity in the 1950s. I don't have the knowledge to comment on these actions. [IBM has not always been on the right side of history though][2].

Then the letter calls for police reform with respect to officer conduct and 

>Responsible technology policies â€“ technology can increase transparency and help police protect communities but must not promote discrimination or racial injustice.

The next paragraph is interesting.

>IBM no longer offers general purpose IBM facial recognition or analysis software. IBM firmly opposes and will not condone uses of any technology, including facial recognition technology offered by other vendors, for mass surveillance, racial profiling, violations of basic human rights and freedoms, or any purpose which is not consistent with our values and Principles of Trust and Transparency. We believe now is the time to begin a national dialogue on whether and how facial recognition technology should be employed by domestic law enforcement agencies.

I applaud IBM for taking this stand. I worry about the use of the term "general purpose facial recognition". This leave the door open for any number of "special purpose facial recognitions". There is no foolproof way to remove bias from AI algorithms. We should be very careful when and where we use them. We must also be careful who has access to the data they generate. AI outputs need to be vetted by qualified people that understand the algorithm, the system it is analysing, and sources of bias and error.

I hope that more companies step up as IBM has here. I do worry though. If we do not see action from the government then other companies will fill the gap because law enforcement agencies want this data. Unless the systems are changed then the actions of IBM and other companies will have little to no effect.
