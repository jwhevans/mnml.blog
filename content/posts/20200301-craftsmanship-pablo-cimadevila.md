12:12 min and worth every second.

Every time I visit Berlin I go to the Deutsches Technikmuseum. They have a jewelry workshop on the lower level with numerous technicians, tools, and fixtures. Watching a wire-fed press produce intricate chains is a form of meditation to me.

This video from Pablo Cimadevila evokes some of those same feelings. In addition to the creativity and artistry of the work, I enjoy the transformation of a humble bolt into a beautiful item.

Hidden from the production are the many false starts, failures, and the long hours Pablo spent honing his craft. The video does convey his love for the work. The love and care that are evident as well as the time invested to develop such a mastery are what draw me to videos like this and are why I keep going back to the Deutsches Technikmuseum.
