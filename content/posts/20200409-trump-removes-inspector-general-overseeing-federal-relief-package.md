>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump removed the inspector general who was to oversee the government’s $2.3 trillion coronavirus response, a spokeswoman for the official’s office said on Tuesday, fueling concerns in Congress about oversight of the relief package.

Of course he did. The man is a narcissist and demands absolute fealty. He already had problems with the inspector general. Unlike many of the things he has done, this is not illegal. It is completely within his powers. He also immediately appointed a new inspector general. It is a disturbing pattern though.
