>“John hit the ground running at Apple and we are thrilled to have him as part of our executive team,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “Machine learning and AI are important to Apple’s future as they are fundamentally changing the way people interact with technology, and already helping our customers live better lives. We’re fortunate to have John, a leader in the AI industry, driving our efforts in this critical area.”

No kidding. Giannandrea was a star before he joined Apple. I believe there is a misconception that Apple trails other companies in AI and ML. While Apple’s services often leave something to be desired, their integration of ML on device is industry leading. This was a good hire. I have high hopes for the Mac and iOS platforms going forward.
