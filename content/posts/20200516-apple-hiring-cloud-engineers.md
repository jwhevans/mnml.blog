According to [MacRumors][1] Apple is on a bit of a hiring spree for software engineers with cloud computing expertise.

>The range of employees Apple has hired has created "a stir" in the "tight-knit cloud community," and is a sign that Apple is perhaps planning to build serious cloud infrastructure to compete with Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.

I think Apple has improved their cloud services significantly over the past few years. Certain aspects of their systems still annoy me and seem to function less well than competitors. In particular I have regular issues with iCloud Sync. I have a 100 Mb/sec connection at home. This week I downloaded a file in Safari at an average rate of 94.6 Mb/sec. On the same day I tried to open and edit a text file on my iPad that is stored in iCloud Drive. The file is 359 bytes. Three days later and it is available on my Mac but will not open on my iPad.
