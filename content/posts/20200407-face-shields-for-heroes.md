I have lived in Houston for over 20 years. I consider myself a Houstonian. There are many things to recommend the city but one thing in particular continues to make me proud.

This is an extremely diverse city. People come from all walks of life and espouse many views. This city shouldn't work, and often it doesn't work well. However, when times are tough the city comes together. All differences are put aside and we are just Houstonians.  

Now is one of those times. Neighbors that never talk are checking on one another. People are standing in the streets at a reasonable distance and are talking. They are offering their time, treasure, and talents to help others.

I also see this mentality in the 3D printing community. I'm very proud of my fellow makers. Their creativity and their humanity is on full display while we are home in this current situation. Many are trying to make personal protective equipment or replacement parts for medical devices. This is commendable, but also I hope that my colleagues do not take actions that could make our situation worse.

It is easy to see the lack of ventilators and other devices as an outrage. It is even easier to see the costs of these devices as outrageous. In some cases this outrage may even be justified. Medical devices undergo a high level of testing to ensure their effectiveness and safety. Making a copy in untested materials with unknown tolerances is dangerous. We should focus our efforts on tested, proven designs, that are fit for our production methods.

The [NIH][2] has a 3D printing exchange that allows downloads of tested devices. Printing these with the recommended settings is an effective way to help. One particularly useful thing we can make are face shields for medical personnel and first responders. In fact, the medical community in Houston are asking for these devices right now.

The Innovation Lab at [Harmony Public schools][5] has taken up this challenge with the help of Houston Community College. They were recently featured in the [Houston Chronicle][4]. They are doing great work and are accepting donations. They have more information about the masks [here][1]. If you can help by printing headbands, or can donate [items necessary to build these masks][3] you should get in touch with them. It is also possible to make donations to the Houston Makerspace, [TxRxLabs][6].
