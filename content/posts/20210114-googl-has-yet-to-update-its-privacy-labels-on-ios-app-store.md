[MacRumors][1] commentary on a [Fast Company][2] article.

>Last month, Apple introduced a new privacy section in the App Store to inform users about some of the data types that apps may collect, and whether that data is linked to them or used to track them. Developers have been required to provide this info to Apple when submitting new apps and app updates to the App Store since December 8, 2020.

>Interestingly, Fast Company noticed that Google has yet to update any of its iPhone and iPad apps since Apple's requirement went into effect, with apps like Gmail, Chrome, and YouTube having last been updated on December 7, 2020 or prior. As a result, all Google apps still say "No Details Provided" under the new privacy section in the App Store, with a notice that "the developer will be required to provide privacy details when they submit their next app update."

I don’t find it interesting. I’m not surprised at all. I think they will wait as long as possible because this type of thing is embarrassing.
