Mark Gurman reporting for [Bloomberg][1] announced yesterday that,

>Apple Inc. is preparing to announce a shift to its own main processors in Mac computers, replacing chips from Intel Corp., as early as this month at its annual developer conference, according to people familiar with the plans.

This has been expected for some time, but if true the timing is sooner than most people expected.

>Apple is using technology licensed from Arm Ltd., part of Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp. This architecture is different from the underlying technology in Intel chips, so developers will need time to optimize their software for the new components. Cupertino, California-based Apple and Santa Clara-based Intel declined to comment.

I donâ€™t know what the licensing terms are for Apple. Apple was a part of the ARM consortium. Their chip designs have diverged from the Arm reference significantly in the iOS line.

>Apple has about 10% of the PC market, so the change may not cut into Intel sales much. However, Macs are considered premium products. So if the company moves away from Intel for performance reasons it may prompt other PC makers to look at different options, too. Microsoft Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. and Lenovo Group Ltd. have already debuted laptops that run on Arm-based chips.

Intel has more revenue streams than consumer chips, but losing 10% of any revenue stream is a significant hit.

>TSMC will build the new Mac processors using a 5-nanometer production technique -- the same approach as for the next iPhones and iPad Pros. Intel rivals Qualcomm Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. also use TSMC to make their chips.

A direct comparison between the Arm and Intel chips does not make sense. They are significantly different and Apple will tune their implementation to the hardware and software. This will represent a node skip for Apple so there should be big changes to power and thermal efficiencies. The engineers will have fun with the new headroom.

Gurman says that this effort has been underway for at least 2 years. That makes sense for a change of this magnitude.
