As of May 2, 2018 [Toolshed.down.net][1] is no more.

Obviously this site has been pretty quiet for some time; there’s only been one news post since 2012, and that was an April Fools joke. The Tour section hasn’t been updated for recent shows, either; there wasn’t even a post announcing the 20-year anniversary of this site. I should have made some kind of site shutdown post years ago; maybe after Tool Madness, which was the last full-scale project here at toolshed — in 2011! For a long time, I may have been holding out hope that a new record was just around the corner. But with today’s inauspicious anniversary, plus with today’s web landscape, I think it’s clear that it’s time to close up shop.

It was a good run and a great source of information around the releases of Ænima, Lateralus, and 10,000 Days. I’ve worn out my Tool albums multiple times and I would genuinely love another album, or tour, anything really. I think I’m ready to abandon hope too. Good-bye Toolshed. Thanks.
