*by Carl Sandburg*

>“I love you for what you are, but I love you yet more for what you are going to be.  
>
>“I love you not so much for your realities as for your ideals. I pray for your desires that they may be great, rather than for your satisfactions, which may be so hazardously little.  
>
>“A satisfied flower is one whose petals are about to fall. The most beautiful rose is one hardly more than a bud wherein the pangs and ecstasies of desire are working for a larger and finer growth.  
>
>“Not always shall you be what you are now.  
>
>“You are going forward toward something great. I am on the way with you and therefore I love you.”  

My girlfriend shared this with me the other day. This is a poem about love and love is about growth. Love makes imperfect things perfect. Love takes small things and makes them great. Love accepts today but embraces tomorrow. I’m thankful tonight. I am loved, not always because of who I am, but because of who I can be.

I promise to post about Iceland babe. I made some progress tonight.
