>Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen skirted responsibility for the death of another migrant child in her agency’s custody by piling blame on those who advocate for “open borders” (Democrats) and the parents and caretakers who bring their children on the “long and dangerous journey” to the U.S. border.

I hope that she does implement better medical screening and that she implements it quickly. However, this is shameful politics. This isn’t a political issue. It’s a human rights issue. The United States of America should be a light on a hill when it comes to human rights. Sadly, this administration is not.
