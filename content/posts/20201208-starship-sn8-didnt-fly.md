SpaceX thought they might test the Starship SN8 prototype today. At some point in the not too distant future it is slated to fly up to 40,000 ft and attempt a vertical landing on a nearby pad. Today wasn't the day. The video feed showed a count down stop at approximately T-13 seconds. I could not tell if it was an abort or a glitch in the feed. The count down resumed and ignition was called at T-0 seconds but the 3 Raptor engines never lit. SpaceX called a stand down for the day. I'll be interested to find out what they learned.
