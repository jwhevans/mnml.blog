Our plant has been operational throughout the coronavirus pandemic. We have had fluctuating capacity but were open and producing. We did our best to protect our teams. I know that we followed the CDC guidelines and often went beyond these guidelines. Two weeks ago one of our employees became sick. We put our tracing plan in place and sent employees for testing. Another positive test required a second round of tracing and testing. 

We stopped production and sanitized all facilities last week. We have all test results back and thankfully there were no more positive tests. Now we are starting production again, but we have improved our work areas to better protect employees. I'm proud of our teams. These decisions are hard. The health and safety of our employees is my top priority but there is significant pressure to continue working. 

I know that there are many small business executives facing the same issues. It's tough. In difficult situations it is more critical that we communicate often and effectively with our teams. I was happy to run across the article [Help Your Employees Manage Their Reentry Anxiety][1] from the Harvard Business Review. 

>While workforce reentry certainly includes logistical and operational planning, it is not just physical well-being that employers must take into account. Equally important is how organizations will respond to employees’ emotional and psychological health —a topic that, regrettably, is discussed far less frequently.

The article offers five specific ways to manage this situation and help employees navigate the difficult transition back to work.
