The Italian news site [Corriere reported on March 26][1] that the real death toll for COVID-19 is at least 4 times the official numbers. They came to this number by looking at the total deaths in the area around Nembro, a particularly hard hit area, over the first 3 months of the year. This was compared to previous averages. In a normal year approximately 30 people would have died. This year there have been just over 30 deaths attributed to COVID-19. We could reason that there should be close to 60 deaths this year. There are over 150.

Something else is going on around Nembro. Corriere posits several possibilities. I believe that some people are dying of complications from COVID-19 and are not tested, therefore they are undercounted, and others are dying from diseases that they would normally survive because the medical system is overrun.

Italy is not alone. Talking Points Memo recently reported on the [situation in Spain][2] (normally behind a paywall, currently free).

>Weâ€™ve now seen the common pattern. A certain region or jurisdiction reports X number of COVID-19 fatalities over a given period. But when the average number of deaths for all causes is compared to these COVID-19 death tolls they are still dramatically higher than the COVID-19 numbers alone can account for. So we see a large number of unexplained deaths that are almost certainly due to the COVID-19 crisis, whether that is people dying of COVID-19 or dying from other causes at higher rates because of the social and medical care disruptions brought in its wake.

The unexplained death rate in Spain is equal to the official COVID-19 death rate.

The United States is exceptional in that our [unexplained morbidity][3] is even higher. In New York City daily "at home deaths" have spiked 10 fold to [more than 200 per day.][4] The medical system in New York City is beyond capacity.

>One grim additional note: As of a few days ago, EMTs and paramedics in New York City have been instructed that patients over 18 in cardiac arrest should be resuscitated on the scene. If they cannot be resuscitated after 20 minutes they cannot be taken to an emergency room.

Other municipalities are either already or will soon face the same problems. This is the price we pay because of a failing health care system. This is the cost inflicted by a [government that is not concerned with the welfare of its citizens.][5]
