>[Salutations. Greetings, old sport. I humbly greet you with a wave of my white-gloved hand. Is this how middle-class people greet one another? I’m only asking because I want to make sure you’re a middle-class American just like I am. I, of course, know how common citizens of this country say hello, for you see, I too am a middle-class person. And, like all middle-class Americans, I sure am excited to reap the rewards of the brand new Republican tax plan.][1]

I believe we need to reform our tax code. Even seasoned tax professional don’t understand it. If you believe your representatives have your interests in mind while they ramrod this legislation through, you are sorely mistaken. I have a better idea. Let’s give all mothers $4000 USD to spend any way they want. That will only cost us $340 billion over ten years and have a far better outcome.
