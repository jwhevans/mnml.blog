>[The cap’s opening and closing action are at the forefront of the pen’s user experience, being so simple and smart that they become the pen’s USP. With zero effort yet maximum satisfaction provided by the clicking sound, the pen’s cap closes securely over the fountain nib. To open, simply twist the cap gently to turn magnetic attraction into repulsion and the cap comes undone on its own. It’s a clever interaction that makes me, as a designer, marvel its simplicity and ingenuity.][1]

This is a simple, classic design. Each version has great finishes. The magnetic mechanism on the cap is charming. I love it.
