Since last year I’ve worked to follow an inclusive set of blogs and twitter feeds. I was intentional about reducing the number of men I follow and added more people that aren’t roughly 40 year old white dudes. I’m glad I did. I have found so many interesting projects in the past year. I’ve had more insightful conversations. I encourage all of you to add more diversity to your feeds this year.

In that vein [Becky Stern][1] recently published a list of women makers. Becky works for Autodesk, has written numerous articles for Make Magazine, and has been featured on several podcasts, including “Cool Tools” which is one of my favorites. I think you should follow Becky’s blog and I think you should check out the amazing makers she has listed. I’m a fan of many but there were a few I didn’t know. I bet there are some you don’t know either.
