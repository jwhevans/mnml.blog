**I’m writing anyway, so why not leave a record**

I write daily. I write a lot. I can’t count the number of reports, how-to’s, procedures, and protocols I’ve written in my professional life. Now that my primary job is management and strategy I write papers and emails (oh the emails). I’m not a good writer but I feel it’s a shame that I write so much and yet very few people will ever read it. I decided to blog because I want to leave a record of the world as I see it and my thoughts on it.

**I write in order to make sense of things**

Information is coming at us from everywhere. If you are like me, you read several newspapers, have a magazine subscription or two, and follow multiple blogs. You probably listen to a long list of podcasts (in [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) at 1.5x with Smart Speed™ enabled). We consume so much. What are we doing with all this information?

I have kept a professional journal for years. I also keep a personal journal. I use it less often but the things I put in it are more important. I write things down when I need to sort things out. Any time I read something I ask myself

* What does it say,
* What does it mean,
* Why does it matter?

Those questions have served me well over the years. Often the answer is trivial. At times it is profound. The answers may come easy. Other times they require reflection. I’ve found that writing fosters an internal dialog that helps me to find the answer to these questions. 

**I believe in democracy and public discourse**

For democracy to flourish there has to be an open exchange of ideas. The internet expanded the possibilities for open discourse beyond any previous invention. I don’t know if democracy is the best form of governance, but I believe it is the best current form. I also believe that many of the systems and innovations that have been built on top of the internet are at best stifling open discourse, and at worst, are creating echo chambers where both good and bad ideas grow without challenge. I support an open web with a myriad of ideas. I blog because I want to add to an open discourse.

**Something I say may be useful to you**

Blogging offers an opportunity to share with others. I’ve taken a lot from others. I hope that I can give a little back. Maybe I’ll inspire you to share a story or spark your interest in something new.
