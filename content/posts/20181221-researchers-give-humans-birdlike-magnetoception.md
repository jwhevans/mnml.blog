>[While birds are able to naturally perceive the Earth’s magnetic field and use it for orientation, humans have so far not come close to replicate this feat – at least, until now. Researchers at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) in Germany have developed an electronic skin (e-skin) with magnetosensitive capabilities, sensitive enough to detect and digitize body motion in the Earth’s magnetic field.][1]

Cool.
