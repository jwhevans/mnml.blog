[Execupundit.com](http://www.execupundit.com) is a great follow. Add it to your favorite RSS reader if you haven't already. Maybe there are new ways to follow, but I'm old-school. I love RSS.

Micheal recently posted a link to a great poem by [Henry Wadsworth Longfellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow), called ["A Psalm of Life"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44644/a-psalm-of-life). It is an excellent choice as a poem to guide us into and through the next year.
