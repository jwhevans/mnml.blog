## Read

### [NetNewsWire][1]

NetNewsWire is my RSS reader of choice. I have used it on the Mac for some time and added it as my default RSS reader on iOS as soon as it was released. I spend more time in NetNewsWire than in any other app. It has a clean interface and is very fast.  

### [Icro][2]

Icro is a client for Micro.blog. I love it because it also has a clean interface and is dead simple to use. I mean that in the best possible way. I hate apps that obfuscate functionality through needless UI. All of Micro.blog is immediately available on Icro.

## Write

### [Textastic][3]

Textastic is my editor of choice. I am a firm believer in plain text and I create much of my plain text here. I have tried many editors. Some were very simple. Some add other functionality to the app. Most of the simple apps performed well as an editor but were lacking in UI. They didn't feel right. The more capable apps often add functionality but lose focus on the editor. I want to focus on my text. Textastic is the second type of app. It is a full fledged plain text editor but also provides for file system management, SFTP, and SSH. It manages to add that functionality and still remain simple to use. I write and publish almost all of the content on this blog and never leave the app. 

## Listen

### [Overcast][4] 

There are several good podcast players on iOS. For someone that occasionally listens to podcasts there is little reason to use anything other than Apple's Podcast app. If you listen to podcasts regularly then you will want to choose based on your listening habits. It seems that most apps try to differentiate themselves by how they handle and prioritize feeds. I care much more about the sound of the podcast than anything else. However, I listen to lots of podcasts made by "regular people". Overcast has an excellent audio engine. Those podcasts sound better in Overcast.

### [Apple Music][5]

Somewhere in the attic are boxes upon boxes of compact discs. Remember those? I still listen to music regularly and all of it comes through Apple Music. It is a good service. If you actively like and dislike songs as they are played the recommendation works very well. It takes some time but the end result is good. The sharing features, particularly in iMessage, are great.

## Work

### [NotePlan][6]

NotePlan has been out for some time. The current version is on the App Store as NotePlan 2. It is a paid app and is worth every dollar. It isn't perfect. It is made by a single developer, but is actively maintained. He is very responsive and a genuinely nice guy. NotePlan is a full-fledged note taking and productivity system. NotePlan is based around your calendar. Every day on the calendar has a note associated with it. You can open the app and start typing your daily notes immediately. It is possible to add other notes that are independent as needed. Markdown is supported. Notes can have tags and links. x-call-back-url is supported for Shortcuts integration. Underneath it all is simple plain text. Nothing is proprietary. Nothing is stored in the app. Your notes are stored in human readable form on your device and synced across iCloud. NotePlan deserves a full blog post. It is an amazing app.

### [Prompt][7]

Prompt is made by the excellent team at Panic. It bills itself as the #1 SSH client on iOS. Maybe it is. I don't know. What I am certain of is that it transformed my use of the iPad. With Prompt I can quickly log on to my servers and run an update, fix an issue, or write some code. I use my Mac much less because of Prompt.

### [PCalc][8]

Do you need a calculator on an iPhone? Yes, and that should not be the default calculator app. PCalc is more Apple than Apple. As far as I know PCalc has existed on all Apple platforms. It is a powerful programmable calculator. It works for basic calculations. It is a great scientific calculator. It is programmable and extensible. There is little that you cannot accomplish with PCalc. It is always in SlideOver on my iPad. By the way, it also supports ARKit ðŸ˜‚

### [Outlook][9]

Someday I will leave the workforce and never check email again. I don't have a problem managing email. I have a great workflow and stay on top of email. The fact that I can handle it does not change the fact that I hate it. I've tried many email apps and none were great. Email is a necessary evil and Outlook doesn't suck. 

### [Fantastical][10]

A calendar isn't important for everyone. It is a big part of my workflow. I've used Fantastical since it was released. It integrates well with Microsoft Exchange and iCloud. I like having my reminders in my calendar and Fantastical connects to Reminders. That is important for me. Calendar sets can be set to change based on your location. I enjoy that my work calendar is not visible on the weekends. Best of all Fantastical has excellent natural language parsing. Creating new events is easy. I can start typing "Meet with Vendor tomorrow at 2:00" and everything is filled out automagically. Oh, the iPad interface is whimsical when connected to the Magic Keyboard. Fantastical is also always in my SlideOver menu.

## Play

### [Octopod][11]

Octopod is a free, open source Octoprint client for iOS devices. If you have a 3D printer and don't use Octoprint go [download][15] it now. Octopod lets you check printer settings, send Gcodes during a print, control your printer and watch the print if you have a web camera. Please don't run your printer when you are not at home. Printers have motors and heaters. Thermal runaway is real and fires happen. I have saved several prints from a spaghetti nightmare by being able to quickly stop the printer when I was working in a different room.

### [Halide][12]

The vast majority of my photography is done on an iPhone using the default camera app. It's a great app and gets better with every update. I think it is the only app most people need for photography. I occasionally know that I want a particular shot, or I know that I want to do postprocessing on a shot. Then I turn to Halide Camera. Halide is made by former Apple engineers. It has a great interface and gives you full control of the camera. You can shoot in raw format and then export to your favorite editor.

## Utilities

### [1Password][13]

1Password is first and foremost a password manager. It also provides a secure vault for important documents, notes, keys, and software licenses. Security is important. Most people don't need to go overboard with security but I believe all of us should be using https, a password manager for strong passwords, and a VPN. 1Password allows you to create one strong but memorable password to protect all your other passwords. It can then create strong unique passwords for all your online accounts. It supports 2FA and informs you if an account offers 2FA. It also watches for compromised passwords and will notify you if you may need to change your password.

### [Mullvad][14]

If you spend any time online you have seen countless ads for VPNs. A VPN is a virtual private network. It routes your traffic through the VPN server and encrypts that connection to help protect you from someone that may be snooping on your connection. I don't want to get into VPNs here. I believe they are important tools in certain circumstances and the only one I have found that I trust is [Mullvad][16].
