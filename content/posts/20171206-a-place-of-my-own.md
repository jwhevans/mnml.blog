My grandmother said something shortly before her death that has caused me pause many times.

>Son, the world is changing so fast and you don’t even see it. I lived in a world where people died from colds, in a world where indoor plumbing was high technology. I watched the electrification of America happen. I saw radios come into homes, people start to drive regularly to visit family, commercial airlines become commonplace. I remember when football was always black and white. Son, I watched a man walk on the moon! *- Myrtice Evans ca. 2003*

You don’t know a world without those things. They just are. They always have been for you. A computer isn’t technology. It’s just a hammer, like every other tool. She was right. Information technology has never been new for me. It has given all of us a life that was utterly amazing to her and yet I rarely think about the impact that it has on my life and on society. Much like a hammer or screwdriver in my garage, it is just a tool that I use and abuse as needed to get a job done.

Our march from Homo sapiens to Homo technologis has profoundly changed all aspects of life, but no where more than in the way we communicate. We are connected as never before. Ideas can move more fluidly than at any time in history. I believe this is possible because the open internet works somewhat like the human brain. Distributed nodes are connected by multiple pathways. This allows for redundancy, resiliency, and creativity at a level that was impossible previously.

I have been a user of the internet for the vast majority of my life but I have never actively participated in it. I have pulled information when necessary and I have benefitted greatly from it’s existence. I consider myself a news junkie,a curious engineer, and an eternal tinkerer. I subscribe to a large number of RSS feeds and I still read the NY Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Economist in print.

This site is my first attempt at actively participating. I don’t know what I’ll say or where it will go but I’m happy to be here. Hello World!
