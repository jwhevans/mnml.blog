[TPM reports][1] that the Department of Homeland Security is switching it's focus to domestic threats.

>The Department of Homeland Security, long relegated to pursuing phantoms of antifa and going after Islamic radicals under the Trump administration, took a significant step this week towards reorienting itself against the fight with domestic terrorism.

Seems like a good idea.
