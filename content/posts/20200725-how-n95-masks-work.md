Nicole Sharp writing at the excellent [FYFD][1] on how the now well-known N95 masks work.

>But, luckily, N95 masks have a solution for that problem, too. The fibers of the mask have an electric charge, which helps them attract particles of all sizes and capture them. Of course, as with all masks, theyâ€™ll work when worn as intended. 

Check out the illustrations and read the quick overview, then watch the video from Minute Physics.
