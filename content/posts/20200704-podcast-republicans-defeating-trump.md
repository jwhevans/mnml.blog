Today is July 4th. It's Independence Day in the United States. As always we celebrate our break from tyrannical rule, but more than ever we realize that many are still oppresed by laws and policies that are inherently biased an unjust. I also realize that the hate which created the sweeping fascist movements in the 1920s and 1930s is not history. It is alive and could sweep our world again. This year we must reaffirm our allegiance to a higher set of ideals. We must strive to perfect this imperfect union.

ðŸŽ™ This year it is important that we defeat Donald Trump and Trumpism at the ballot box. One group that is leading the charge is [The Lincoln Project][1]. I do not always agree with the principal leaders of the group but I believe they are doing good work and I agree with them on more points than I disagree. They have an excellent [podcast][2].
