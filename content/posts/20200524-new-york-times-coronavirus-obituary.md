[Today’s Front Page][1]

> They were not simply names on a list. They were us.

In a word...sobering.

The NYT has run some graphics this year that are arresting on a full size newspaper. Today they published a text only obituary of America. It is a haunting reminder of what has transpired this year.

- **Myles Coker**, 69, New York City, freed from life in prison
- **Theresa Elloie**, 63, New Orleans, renowned for her business making detailed pins and corsages
- **Sandy Pratt**, 92, Bellevue, Wash., engineer forever chasing the wind
- **Alan Merrill**, 69, New York City, song-writer of “I Love Rock ‘n’ Roll”
- **Bassey Offiong**, 25, Michigan, saw friends at their worst but brought out their best

Five people out of one hundred thousand that lost their lives. The NYT listed one thousand in total. The numbers are not the story. Viruses do not discriminate. They are a human problem and the cost is the lives of the people we love.
