I had no idea that mushrooms could be made into leather. Apparently, there is significant interest in mushroom leather from many industries that are interested in the look, feel, and properties of traditional animal leather without the ecological side-effects caused by the industry.

I donâ€™t think [this article][1] is particularly well written, but it does cover a wide range of topics and the links within the article are quite good.
