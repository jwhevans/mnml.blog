Developer and noted software spelunker Guilherme Rambo has released version 2 of his Mac app [AirBuddy][1]. AirBuddy makes AirPods work on your Mac much like they do on your iOS devices. You can open the case and connect. There are also global shortcuts to manage your listening modes and an overview of all your devices in the menu bar. It’s great and it’s cheap at $9.99.
