I was recently introduced to [Rebecca Toh’s blog][1]. Those of you that have followed her for a while know just how good it is. If you don’t know of her I suggest you follow her. Her post from last week, [“the elegant joy of black and white photography”][2] is mesmerizing. I love the lighting and perspective in the photo of the Transamerica Pyramid. I also find the humanity of two diners charming.
