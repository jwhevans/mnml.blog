The [New York Times][1] reports this afternoon that,

>Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, has told associates that he believes President Trump committed impeachable offenses and that he is pleased that Democrats are moving to impeach him, believing that it will make it easier to purge him from the party, according to people familiar with his thinking. The House is voting on Wednesday to formally charge Mr. Trump with inciting violence against the country.

Say what you will about “Moscow” Mitch McConnell but don’t call him dumb and don’t call him weak. He’s a slick political operative. Other reports say that he is extremely angry with Trump over the recent riots. I think this was finally a bridge too far for Mitch. He has the power and he may now have the will to finish Trump. I believe Trump’s political career is over.
