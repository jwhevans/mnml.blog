He was an incredible actor. He was too young to pass from this world. Chadwick Boseman, the star of *Black Panther*, *42*, *Get On Up*, and *Da 5 Bloods* died from colon cancer yesterday. I didnâ€™t know he was battling cancer. That fact says something about his character. His performances and his humanity over these last four years are even more meaningful.

Wakanda forever!
