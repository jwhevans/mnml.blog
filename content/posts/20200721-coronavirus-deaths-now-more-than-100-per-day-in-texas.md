Coronavirus cases have been growing at a rapid rate in Texas for over a month. Until recently deaths were not growing as quickly. That has changed. We are now seeing more than 100 deaths per day according to the [Texas Tribune][1]. Unfortunately, it is almost certain that this number is grossly undercounted.
