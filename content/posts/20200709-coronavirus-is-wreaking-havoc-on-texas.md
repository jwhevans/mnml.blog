I’ve been on vacation this week. After two weeks of dealing with some cases of the coronavirus at work, I am happy that I can take some time off with the family. I’ve stayed away from the news for the most part. Because of that I did not comment on last week’s job report. 

Texas made the choice to open its economy in May after a relatively minor brush with the coronavirus. The economy was in freefall. We were losing well over 200,000 jobs per week. A large part of this was service sector jobs. Another larger percentage were in the oil and gas sector due to dramatically reduced demand for oil. Opening the economy reduced job losses, although they still remain above the 2008 recession levels.

The reopening plan did not address the coronavirus risk. For several weeks public health experts sounded the alarm that we were not out of the woods and that people should continue to stay home if possible, wear a mask in public always, and continue with general sanitation. I saw a significant reduction in mask use over the past month. Now coronavirus cases are growing at the highest rate since the beginning of the pandemic. In several areas including the Houston metropolitan area, ICUs are near or at capacity. What happened to New York City in March and April is a very real possibility here.

The [Texas Tribune][1] reported that job losses are picking up again. They report that over 96,000 Texans lost their jobs the last week of June. The state government is starting to take actions. A general mask order was put in place just before the July 4th holiday. Bars were closed again. Still, it seems that the plan is to maintain as much economic activity as possible. I believe this misguided. I think we will see increasing unemployment numbers, continued reduction in tax revenues, and the overall result will be worse for our state than if we would have taken more decisive actions earlier.
