Two years ago researchers at Harvard University created a small amphibious robot nicknamed [(HAMR) Harvard Ambulatory Microbot][1]. They recently shrunk this HAMR by half. The new [HAMR-Jr][2] is the size of a penny and can run at 14 body lengths per second.

>Directly scaled up to human size — and not accounting for factors like mass — that’s more than twice the speed as world record sprinter Usain Bolt.

The design is simple and the manufacturing process is elegant. The main structure is etched two-dimensionally and is then folded into a three-dimensional shape. The structure also looks amenable to 3D printing.
