According to a report from [Reuters][1] citing an unnamed source, Toyota plans to cut North American production by as much as 30% into the fourth quarter of 2020. Given the overall slowdown that we are facing economically during the coronavirus crisis this is not surprising. Each of these reports is another data point pointing toward a deep retraction in economic output. 

In a second report [Reuters][2] also stated that car manufacturers in Michigan are opening their plants. Some optimistic reports state that thousands of workes will be back at work in a few days. Factories will not open and ramp production that fast. When major automakers close factories the supply chain has to close as well. The supply chain is not going to bounce back quickly and evenly across North America.

We are in a very difficult situation. My company provides goods for "essential" infrastructure and has remained open through the pandemic. We are trying to protect our employees and are looking for better ways to ensure their safety each day. We see our customers furloughing or laying off significant numbers of personnel and they are cutting output. I would love for the economy to open so that I could ensure my employees of their economic safety. Unfortunately, that may not be possible. I would not bet on the size of the economic retraction we will see before this hits bottom. I am sure that it will be significant and I will be surprised if it is less than 25%.
