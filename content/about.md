This site was originally created as a learning exercise. Then I decided to post some things. Then I quit. Then I started back again.

Hi, I'm James. Welcome to my website. I work in manufacturing. I've held positions as a manufacturing engineer, engineering manager, and quality assurance manager, but I've been in corporate management for some time now. That means I no longer work on the fun stuff. I make up for that through my hobbies. I have wonderful children that want to learn everything. I have to stay on my toes to keep up with them. I enjoy robotics and that has pushed my interest in design, mechatronics, and most recently, 3D printing. My main printer is a [Prusa MK3S][5]. I post some of my designs and prints at [PrusaPrinters.org][6]. 

The site has changed regularly since its inception. I like to tinker with things and I'm never happy with the style. One thing is constant. My domains are always registered with [Hover][8]. Here's a short change log in reverse chronological order:
