I updated my site to include webmentions by setting up an account at [webmention.io][1]. I added the relevant links in my header partials and am currently pulling in mentions from [micro.blog][2] with `<script type="text/javascript" src="https://micro.blog/conversation.js?url={{ .Permalink }}"></script>` as mentioned in the micro.blog help files. How can I get webmentions from other sites? Any help is appreciated.
