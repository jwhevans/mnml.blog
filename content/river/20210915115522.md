Iâ€™ve mentioned before that I run DietPi on all my RasperryPi systems. Raspbian and DietPi are both Debian based and have been based on Debian 10 (buster) for some time. DietPi just released Debian 11 (bullseye) based images. Images and upgrade instructions are available on the [DietPi Blog](https://dietpi.com/blog/?p=811).
