      <title>Copy CSV File Into Postgresql Table</title>
      <author>James Evans</author>

      <guid>https://mnml.blog/2021/01/copy-csv-file-into-postgresql-table/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Often data is passed around in ‚Äúcomma separated files‚Äù (.csv). Postgresql has a function that copies this data into existing tables. Let‚Äôs imagine you have a set of employee data that you need to copy into a table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First create the table. For the purposes of this exercise our table looks like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;CREATE TABLE employee (
  id SERIAL,
  first_name    VARCHAR(50),
  last_name     VARCHAR(50),
  date_of_birth DATE,
  email         VARCHAR(255),
  date_of_hire  DATE
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CSV file looks like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;FIRST NAME, LAST NAME, DATE OF BIRTH, EMAIL, DATE OF HIRE
John, Doe, 1970-03-31, john.doe@example.com, 2006-07-05
Jane, Doe, 1986-06-03, jane.doe@example.com, 2018-03-01
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;To import the file run the following while connected to your database&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;COPY employee
FROM ‚Äòpath_to_csv‚Äô
DELIMITER ‚Äò,‚Äô
CSV HEADER;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is best to use absolute paths in the FROM clause. You can change the DELIMITER if your file uses a different delimiter. For example, we often delimit file with ‚Äò|‚Äô because other standard delimiters are present in some of our fields. If your CSV does not include a HEADER you can omit that line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postgres will inform you that it completed the task above by printing &lt;code&gt;COPY 2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Google Has Yet to Update Its Privacy Labels on the iOS App Store</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/05/google-hasnt-updated-ios-apps-since-privacy-labels/&#34;&gt;MacRumors&lt;/a&gt; commentary on a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fastcompany.com/90591066/googles-ios-apps-havent-been-updated-in-weeks-apples-privacy-labels-could-be-the-reason-why&#34;&gt;Fast Company&lt;/a&gt; article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Apple introduced a new privacy section in the App Store to inform users about some of the data types that apps may collect, and whether that data is linked to them or used to track them. Developers have been required to provide this info to Apple when submitting new apps and app updates to the App Store since December 8, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Fast Company noticed that Google has yet to update any of its iPhone and iPad apps since Apple&amp;rsquo;s requirement went into effect, with apps like Gmail, Chrome, and YouTube having last been updated on December 7, 2020 or prior. As a result, all Google apps still say &amp;ldquo;No Details Provided&amp;rdquo; under the new privacy section in the App Store, with a notice that &amp;ldquo;the developer will be required to provide privacy details when they submit their next app update.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt find it interesting. I‚Äôm not surprised at all. I think they will wait as long as possible because this type of thing is embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; data-dnt=&#34;true&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Apple should run a full page ad that‚Äôs just this :P &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/DTHh6FAtvZ&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/DTHh6FAtvZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Guilherme Rambo (@_inside) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/_inside/status/1339689228549181440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;December 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Each year American University releases a list of automobiles ranked by total domestic content (TDC). &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.american.edu/kogod/research/autoindex/2020-auto-index.cfm&#34;&gt;This year‚Äôs list&lt;/a&gt; is available on their website. The 2020 Ford Ranger tops the list. Ford and GMC have the most automobiles on the list but Honda Motor Company is also well represented. The automobile industry utilizes a distributed and global supply chain so nothing is made 100% in America.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I posted to this blog 264 times in 2020. That is significantly more than in any previous year. I hope to post even more this year. I know that is easier said than done but I have a plan. I‚Äôm going to make this website the central repository for more of my knowledge, interests, and hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is so easy to accumulate digital information and I collect it in many different ways. I am going to start putting things here first and I will consolidate old information to the site as I use it. I hope that makes it easier for me to find things in the future and I also hope that it benefits some of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was inspired by an old but still relevant talk by Scott Hanselman at Webstock 2012, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Not What You Read, It‚Äôs What You Ignore‚Äù. I‚Äôve embedded the video below. This is a hilarious presentation. It is worth watching multiple times. It is dense with useful information. One point that sticks with me is the idea that we only have a finite number of keystrokes. Rather than waste them in closed silos, we should use our blogs as multipliers of our keystrokes. That gets back to what the internet should be, at least in my opinion. It should be an open platform that democratizes information and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SpaceX has made the impossible a common occurrence. Yesterday evening they started 2021 with another successful launch and landing of the Falcon 9 booster. This is the fourth recovery of the rocket used during the launch and the 71st successful recovery in the program‚Äôs history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mnml.blog/img/20210107-spacex-launch.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Falcon 9 in Flight&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This mission placed the Turksat 5A satellite produced by Airbus into geostationary orbit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At just over T+8 minutes the first stage booster performed a perfect landing on the autonomous drone ship ‚ÄúJust Read The Instructions‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

If you haven‚Äôt check it out below. It‚Äôs the perfect song to show off the current capabilities of these systems. Ten years ago Atlas couldn‚Äôt walk on a treadmill with support. Now it‚Äôs dancing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>We Voted Him Out. He Needs To Go Now.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bret Stephens in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/opinion/impeach-trump.html&#34;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn‚Äôt hard to see, when it began, that it would end exactly the way it has. Donald Trump is America‚Äôs willful arsonist, the man who lit the match under the fabric of our constitutional republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The duty of the House of Representatives and the Senate, once they certify Joe Biden‚Äôs election, is to reconvene, Wednesday night if possible, to impeach the president and then remove him from office and bar him from ever holding office again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To allow Trump to serve out his term, however brief it may be, puts the nation‚Äôs safety at risk, leaves our reputation as a democracy in tatters and evades the inescapable truth that the assault on Congress was an act of violent sedition aided and abetted by a lawless, immoral and terrifying president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man is a life-long criminal. He has already been impeached. Senate Republicans did not remove him from office because they were cowards. They cannot undo the past but they can overturn their mistake. It is not too late to impeach the president again and this time they must remove him from office immediately. Our Constitution demands it. We should not let him finish his term.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Automator for Quick Google Translate Queries</title>
      <author>James Evans</author>
      <link>https://mnml.blog/2021/01/using-automator-for-quick-google-translate-queries/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Jan 2021 20:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mnml.blog/2021/01/using-automator-for-quick-google-translate-queries/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I work for a company with global offices. Many of my colleagues speak German as their primary language. We often need to translate words and documentation between languages. Google translate is still not a substitute for a professional translation, but it is helpful. I find myself cutting and pasting words and phrases to it all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I decided that I should automate the task. The Automator application on macOS allows for the creation of ‚Äúservices‚Äù that run automation from any app. I created an automation that takes selected text as an input and then sends that text to Google Translate directly. This saves several steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mnml.blog/img/automator-google-translate.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Automator Workflow&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I created a new ‚ÄúQuick Action‚Äù within Automator. Then from the ‚ÄúUtilities‚Äù Library I added an action to ‚ÄúRun Applescript‚Äù. The script takes the selected text as an input. I create a variable called ‚Äúsite‚Äù that uses the input parameter to properly format the Google Translate URL. Translating between other languages is as easy as updating the letters following ?sl= and &amp;amp;tl=. For example, German to English is &lt;code&gt;?sl=de&amp;amp;tl=en&lt;/code&gt; while English to German is &lt;code&gt;?sl=en&amp;amp;tl=en&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After saving and installing the workflow should be available anywhere in the system by selecting some text, then right clicking and opening the ‚ÄúServices‚Äù context menu. A new Safari window will open to translate.google.com with your word already translated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why The Running Game Matters</title>
      <author>James Evans</author>
      <link>https://mnml.blog/2021/01/why-the-running-game-matters/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Jan 2021 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mnml.blog/2021/01/why-the-running-game-matters/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The NFL loves to showcase its gunslinging quarterbacks. They get an inordinate amount of time on the highlight reel. &lt;a href=&#34;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/as-it-turns-out-you-do-need-a-run-game-just-ask-the-steelers/&#34;&gt;FiveThirtyEight points out why a strong run game is necessary for consistent results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since that Patriots team won it all in 2003, only nine of the bottom 20 rushing teams to have appeared in the playoffs were able to get a single win in the postseason. But of those nine teams, three won the Super Bowl: the 2008 Steelers, the 2010 Green Bay Packers and the 2011 New York Giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Giants SuperBowl win was an outlier. It defied probability. I lost a lot of money that offseason. Green Bay had one of the best receiving corps in modern history. The Steelers had a phenomenal defence. Those things happen, but in general balanced teams have a far better win percentage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron Rodgers is playing at an MVP level this year and his receiving group is solid. Davante Adams is arguably the best receiver in the game and Robert Tonyan is playing very well. The others are role players but they play their roles well. I think Green Bay can win it all this year though. The running game is great. Jones, Williams, and Dillon are quite a trio.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tryolabs Top Python Libraries of 2020</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As they have done for several years, Tryolabs recently released their &lt;a href=&#34;https://tryolabs.com/blog/2020/12/21/top-10-python-libraries-of-2020/&#34;&gt;‚ÄúTop 20 Python Libraries of 2020‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are simple. We are looking for libraries that satisfy the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They were launched or popularized in 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are well maintained and have been since their launch data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are outright cool, and you should check them out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm a big fan of #4, Pretty Errors. I make lots of mistakes and anything that helps me find the error more quickly is beneficial. #10, Scalene, is also a nice utility if you work with multi-threaded code. I just recently started working with multi-threaded programs and they are a mess to profile in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These little &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.friendlyarm.com/index.php?route=product/product&amp;amp;product_id=266&#34;&gt;single board computers&lt;/a&gt; (SBC) seem great. I think I will pick up a couple of them and test them as a PiHole and file server.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a post to Slashdot, msmash states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://apple.slashdot.org/story/20/12/29/1825241/apple-researching-keyboards-with-adaptive-displays-on-each-key?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&#34;&gt;Apple is researching keyboards with small displays on the keys to dynamically change the label on each key, according to a newly-granted patent filing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt care much for the touch bar but this would be useful. I would like the ability to change my keyboard layout and actually see the keys remap. It could also be beneficial if the keys mapped differently for different operating systems and/or programs.&lt;/p&gt;

I‚Äôm not a professional linux admin and I definitely need all the help I can get with security. There is a lot here and it‚Äôs in an easy to use format. Keep it handy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;üìö My sister sent me a few books for Christmas. I‚Äôve been reading through the short stories in Bill O‚ÄôNeill‚Äôs &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookshop.org/a/11073/9781648450440&#34;&gt;‚ÄúInteresting Stories for Curious People‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;. It‚Äôs just a fun book of random facts. For example, many people are still taught in grade school that Columbus could not secure funding for an Atlantic crossing to ‚ÄúAsia‚Äù because people believed the earth was flat. That is entirely false. Ptolemy had produced modern style spherical maps with latitude and longitude in the 5th Century CE. Though lost for a time, these maps were common knowledge and widely accepted in Columbus‚Äô day. You will know many of the things in this book. Still it‚Äôs fun for friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The kids and I kicked off the new year by building a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_engine&#34;&gt;Stirling Cycle engine&lt;/a&gt;. We used a 3D print kit from the excellent site &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stirlingengines.co.uk&#34;&gt;Kontax Stirling Engines&lt;/a&gt;. Print files are available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/47774&#34;&gt;PrusaPrinters.org&lt;/a&gt;. I modified the settings slightly. Print time was a little over 6 hours. The manual is well done. My seven year old was able to follow along with no issues. Our engine runs well. It will operate on the printer‚Äôs heat bed at 25¬∞C above ambient. At 35¬∞C above ambient it turns at approximately 120 rpm.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I intended to read a little more this year. The coronavirus pandemic gave me an opportunity but I invested in a 3D printer and threw myself into a new hobby instead. #4 is part of a children‚Äôs series. We have several of the Pigeon books now. My kids love them. If you haven‚Äôt read ‚ÄúThe Chain‚Äù, pick it up as soon as possible. Most of the links below are to my Bookshop.org site. If you want to read any of these books and feel like offsetting my hosting costs you can purchase through the site. If you don‚Äôt, I won‚Äôt know the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Connecting to Oracle from Python on macOS Big Sur</title>
      <author>James Evans</author>
      <link>https://mnml.blog/2020/12/connecting-to-oracle-from-python-on-macos-big-sur/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Dec 2020 01:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://mnml.blog/2020/12/connecting-to-oracle-from-python-on-macos-big-sur/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After upgrading one of my machines to macOS Big Sur my Python scripts that were connected to an Oracle database broke. I was able to fix them as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use cx_Oracle to handle connections to the database. Within my oracle environment I installed cx_Oracle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;python -m pip install cx_Oracle --upgrade
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous versions of macOS worked with the Oracle Instant Client libraries 12.2. Newer versions are available. I was unable to connect using 12.2 or 18.1. I installed the 19.8 version from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/macos-intel-x86-downloads.html&#34;&gt;Oracle Downloads Site&lt;/a&gt;. If you are only scripting from Python then the Basic Lite version is sufficient. I unzipped these files to ~/Oracle/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously I was able to use cx_oracle by exporting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Several online resources recommend this, e.g. at the command line run &lt;code&gt;export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=‚Äù~/Oracle/instantclient_19_8/&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;. Doing this on Big Sur led to a connection error DPI:1047.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead I was able to solve the connection error by starting each script with a call to cx_Oracle.init_oracle_client()&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/usr/local/bin/python3

import cx_Oracle

cx_Oracle.init_oracle_client(lib_dir=&amp;quot;/Users/your-name/Oracle/instantclient_19_8&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</description>
