      <description>&lt;p&gt;As they have done for several years, Tryolabs recently released their &lt;a href=&#34;https://tryolabs.com/blog/2020/12/21/top-10-python-libraries-of-2020/&#34;&gt;“Top 20 Python Libraries of 2020”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are simple. We are looking for libraries that satisfy the following conditions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They were launched or popularized in 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are well maintained and have been since their launch data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are outright cool, and you should check them out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of #4, Pretty Errors. I make lots of mistakes and anything that helps me find the error more quickly is beneficial. #10, Scalene, is also a nice utility if you work with multi-threaded code. I just recently started working with multi-threaded programs and they are a mess to profile in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Connecting to Oracle from Python on macOS Big Sur</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After upgrading one of my machines to macOS Big Sur my Python scripts that were connected to an Oracle database broke. I was able to fix them as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use cx_Oracle to handle connections to the database. Within my oracle environment I installed cx_Oracle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;python -m pip install cx_Oracle --upgrade
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous versions of macOS worked with the Oracle Instant Client libraries 12.2. Newer versions are available. I was unable to connect using 12.2 or 18.1. I installed the 19.8 version from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/macos-intel-x86-downloads.html&#34;&gt;Oracle Downloads Site&lt;/a&gt;. If you are only scripting from Python then the Basic Lite version is sufficient. I unzipped these files to ~/Oracle/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously I was able to use cx_oracle by exporting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Several online resources recommend this, e.g. at the command line run &lt;code&gt;export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=”~/Oracle/instantclient_19_8/&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;. Doing this on Big Sur led to a connection error DPI:1047.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead I was able to solve the connection error by starting each script with a call to cx_Oracle.init_oracle_client()&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/usr/local/bin/python3

import cx_Oracle

cx_Oracle.init_oracle_client(lib_dir=&amp;quot;/Users/your-name/Oracle/instantclient_19_8&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</description>
