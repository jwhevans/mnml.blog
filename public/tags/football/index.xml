      <description>&lt;p&gt;The NFL loves to showcase its gunslinging quarterbacks. They get an inordinate amount of time on the highlight reel. &lt;a href=&#34;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/as-it-turns-out-you-do-need-a-run-game-just-ask-the-steelers/&#34;&gt;FiveThirtyEight points out why a strong run game is necessary for consistent results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since that Patriots team won it all in 2003, only nine of the bottom 20 rushing teams to have appeared in the playoffs were able to get a single win in the postseason. But of those nine teams, three won the Super Bowl: the 2008 Steelers, the 2010 Green Bay Packers and the 2011 New York Giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Giants SuperBowl win was an outlier. It defied probability. I lost a lot of money that offseason. Green Bay had one of the best receiving corps in modern history. The Steelers had a phenomenal defence. Those things happen, but in general balanced teams have a far better win percentage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaron Rodgers is playing at an MVP level this year and his receiving group is solid. Davante Adams is arguably the best receiver in the game and Robert Tonyan is playing very well. The others are role players but they play their roles well. I think Green Bay can win it all this year though. The running game is great. Jones, Williams, and Dillon are quite a trio.&lt;/p&gt;
